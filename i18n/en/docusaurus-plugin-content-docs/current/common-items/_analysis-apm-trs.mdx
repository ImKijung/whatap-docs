Home > Select Project > **_STAT/REPORT_** > **_Statistics_**

Select a project in the initial screen of the WhaTap monitoring service, and then select **_STAT/REPORT_** > **_Statistics_** under **_Project Menu_**. The WhaTap agent collects statistical data for the key trace information such as transaction information and SQL. A list is created every 5 minutes and is sent to the server.

## Basic screen guide

<ImgLang img='analysis-apm-trs.png' desc='Statistics' />

-   Each **_Statistics_** tab provides sorting options by **_Sum_**, **_Max_**, **_Time avg_**, and **_Count_** for viewing the list from your desired perspective. 

-   You can add or exclude columns to view from the list as well as the default values by using the **_Select Column_** button. 

-   Select the ![Right Arrow icon](/img/ic-caret-right.svg) **_Arrow_** icon in the **_Statistics_** list to view the counts and average time charts. If you select a desired time point to search from the chart, the **_transaction_** search menu appears.

-   When you select **_Application comparison_**, you can see the balancing by comparing the **_call count_**, **_response time_**, and **_error count_** between applications.

## Transaction statistics

It collects statistics for transactions. Every 5 minutes, up to 5,000 URL-specific performance statistics are collected and sent to the server. If the number of URLs for 5 minutes exceeds 5,000, this is ignored.

| Columns                       | Description                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Transactions                  | Transaction address                                  |

| Time Avg (ms)                 | Average of the total response time                   |
| Time Sum (ms)                 | Sum of response times                                |
| Time Max (ms)                 | Maximum response time                                |
| CPU usage time avg            | Average of the CPU usage time                        |
| HTTPC count                   | HTTP call count                                      |
| HTTP call time avg (ms)       | Average of the total HTTP call time                  |
| SQL Count                     | SQL execution count                                  |
| SQL time avg (ms)             | Average SQL execution time                           |

| SQL fetch time avg (ms)       | Average of the total SQL patch time                  |

:::note

**_Average memory allocation_** is collected only when `trace_malloc_enabled=true` is set. The default value is `false`.

## Transaction domain statistics

The WhaTap agent can collect transaction statistics for each domain. In the systems where multiple domains are separated and serviced on a server, domain-specific analysis may be required. Set the following option:

```ini title='whatap.conf'
stat_domain_enabled=true
```

Through the collected data, you can identify the processing status of URLs for each domain.

| Columns            | Description                                          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Domain             | Service domain                                       |
| Transactions       | Transaction address                                  |
| Count              | Number of execution cases                            |
| Error              | Error occurrence count for the executed transactions |
| Time Avg (ms)      | Average of the total response time                   |

## Transaction caller statistics

If the multi server is connected by a rest call, the relationship statistics between **callers** and **callees** can be collected. To collect this data, set the following options:

```ini title='whatap.conf'
mtrace_rate=100
mtrace_spec=v1
stat_mtrace_enabled=true
```

![msa-system](https://img.whatap.io/media/agent_java/data/msa.png)

In the above architecture, the **Caller & Callee** statistics can be viewed only in api1 and api2. The system called by the user browser cannot see the **Caller** statistics.

However, because the server on the **caller** side must transfer data, the relevant settings must be entered for all servers.

```ini title='whatap.conf of [front]'
mtrace_rate=100
mtrace_spec=v1
stat_mtrace_enabled=true
```

```ini title='whatap.conf of [api1] & [api2]'
mtrace_spec=v1
stat_mtrace_enabled=true
```

The statistical data collected is as follows. The data must be viewed from the **callee** side.

| Columns            | Description                                                       |

| CallerOkind        | Group unit to which the agent corresponding to the caller belongs |
| CallerUrl          | Address of the caller transaction                                 |
| Transactions       | Callee transaction address                                        |
| Count              | Number of execution cases                                         |
| Error              | Error occurrence count for the executed transactions              |
| Time Avg (ms)      | Average of the total response time                                |

## Transaction referer statistics{#stat-referer}

The WhaTap agent can collect transaction statistics for each referer. Set the following option:

```ini title='whatap.conf'
stat_referer_enabled=true
```

Through the collected data, you can see the referer data on the statistics.

| Columns            | Description                                          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Referer            | Referer address                                      |
| Transactions       | Transaction address                                  |
| Count              | Number of execution cases                            |
| Error              | Error occurrence count for the executed transactions |
| Time Avg (ms)      | Average of the total response time                   |

## Error Statistics

They are statistics on the service errors that occurred for 5 minutes. They collect different errors and transaction names with the keys. They provide the stacks upon error occurrence. The statistics appear for up to 1,000 errors every 5 minutes.

| Columns      | Description           |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| Class        | Error Class           |

| Count        | Error Count           |

## SQL execution statistics

The SQL execution statistics for 5 minutes are collected. A maximum of 5,000 SQL statements are allowed in 5 minutes. If a single Java process generates SQL statements that exceed the limit, they are discarded from statistical data.

| Columns                 | Description                                                        |

:::info

**_Transaction_** collects one of the URLs (last call URL) that called the SQL for 5 minutes for analysis.

:::

## HTTP call execution statistics

They collect the statistics of calls outside the applications for 5 minutes via the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. A maximum of 5,000 HTTP call statements are allowed in 5 minutes. If a single application process generates external HTTP call statements that exceed the limit, they are discarded from statistical data.

| Columns            | Description                                                              |

| Service            | Data randomly collected from one of the URLs that requested the HTTP API |

## Number of calls for each client IP region

The physical distance between the server and the client is proportional to the data transfer time. It statistically collects call counts for each region of the client IP. The number of different IPs that can be collected per 5 minutes is up to 70,000 per instance.

| Columns        | Description                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| IP             | Client IP address           |
| Country/Region | User access country         |
| City           | User access city            |
| Count          | Total call count            |

:::info

WhaTap basically stores the client-related information. For more information about the agent settings for user data collection, see [the following](agent-number-of-user).

:::

### Share chart by region

The share chart collects user access locations and presents them for each country and city. 

-   If a country is selected, the detailed chart appears to display each country's cities and connected user IPs.
-   If you select the center circle, it goes to the country selection chart.

## Call counts for each user agent

The numbers of calls for each hash of the user agent string are collected. There is a maximum of 500 different user agent hashes for each instance that can be collected every 5 minutes.

| Columns              | Description                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
