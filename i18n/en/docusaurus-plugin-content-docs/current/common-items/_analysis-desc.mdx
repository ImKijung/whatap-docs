It provides a menu that allows you to analyze the application environment from various perspectives. You can identify the zones with high load or poor performance and provide various performance metrics to check the daily status. You can also trace and analyze transactions for performance measurement.

Through the analysis provided by WhaTap, you can analyze key performances, identify the problems, and respond to any failures that may occur.

### <Cmdname sid="daily_app_stat" />

You can check the daily trends of the application's key performance metrics through the hourly chart. For more information, see [the following](application-daily-stat).

### <Cmdname sid="perfTrend" />

By charting the trends of key application performance metrics for a specific period, you can quickly identify the zones with high load or poor performance, and point the time zone when a problem occurred. For more information, see [the following](performance-trend).

### <Cmdname sid="tag_count_chart" />

You can search the metrics through visualized charts. For more information, see [the following](metrics-chart).

### <Cmdname sid="tag_count" />

You can view the performance metrics for categorized applications by using the data organized based on the tags and fields. For more information, see [the following](metrics-search).

<InDoc product="java,python,dotnet">

### <Cmdname sid="stack" />

It collects transaction stacks and provides the usage statistics for executing methods and the statistics on commonly used stacks. Through the stacks for running transactions, you can identify long-running methods or short-running but frequently running methods. For more information, see [the following](analysis-apm).

### <Cmdname sid="cube_navigator" />

Performance statistics created every 5 minutes are called "Cubes." A statistical analysis tool for post analysis can set a zone with high response time, error count, and throughput. During the same time zone, the problem factors can be identified or the services can be monitored. The geographic traffic distribution and resource usage can be identified. For more information, see [the following](cube).

### <Cmdname sid="hitmap" />

It provides a distribution chart expressing the response time to user requests over time. Depending on the type of distribution chart, it is helpful to identify the type of failure occurred. For more information, see [the following](trs-view).

### <Cmdname sid="multi_server_transaction_trace" />

It traces calls between transactions associated with different agents or projects. The transactions and trace data are provided so that you can see various call relationships at a glance within or between systems, and identify where problems occurred for improvement. For more information, see [the following](analysis-trace-mtx).

### <Cmdname sid="tx_search" />

You can view the statistics on the performance properties and execution status for each transaction for a specific period of time. You can view all transactions and quickly check their status (normal or error). Through the provided information, you can find which transactions are busy and resource-consuming. Various filters can be enabled depending on the transaction properties, making it useful in finding transactions with specific conditions. For more information, see [the following](tx-profile).
