<Cmdname sid="application_dashboard" className="uitext" /> allows you to collect key metrics of applications through agents, configure charts to monitor the metrics in real time, and view the past data. You can quickly identify and analyze application problems by using the widgets on the dashboard.

In case of general charts excluding CPU and memory, the stable data appears in blue and the elements identified as problems appear in red, making it easy to recognize the current status.
