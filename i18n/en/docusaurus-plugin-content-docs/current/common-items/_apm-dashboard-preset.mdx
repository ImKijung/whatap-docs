## Preset

![Preset](/img/apm-dashboard-preset-default.png)

You can save and load the settings and layouts for widgets on the dashboard. The default preset (<Cmdname sid="kube_default" className="uitext" />) cannot be changed, but you can create a new preset by resizing and placing widgets in the desired format.

### Creating a new preset

1. Place the widgets in the desired format on the dashboard. You can also resize and place only the widgets to be frequently checked.

2. On the upper right of the screen, select ![Save icon](/img/ic-save.svg).

3. Enter a new preset name.

   <ImgLang img='apm-dashboard-preset-save.png' desc='Save Preset' />

   To save the selected agent data, select <Cmdname sid="ITM07345" className="uitext" />.

4. Select <Cmdname sid="save" className="uitext" />.

You can see the newly saved preset from the preset list.

:::note

- If any changes are made to the newly created preset, save the preset again. Select ![Save icon](/img/ic-save.svg) and then save the preset with the same name. Any changes are overwritten in the existing preset.

- If you go to another menu without saving changes on the dashboard, the changes are not saved.

- Presets are saved in your user account and cannot be shared with other users. We plan to update it for better features.

### Deleting presets

If you have unused presets, you can delete them from the preset list. Select ![Delete icon](/img/ico-remove.svg) on the right of the item to delete from the preset list.
