## Editing a dashboard widget

The widgets on the dashboard can be adjusted to the desired size and placed in the desired positions. You can also delete unnecessary widgets or add them again.

### Resizing a widget

Click and hold the mouse on the ![Resize icon](/img/ic-widget-size.svg) element at the lower right of the widget, and then drag it to the desired size. Grids with a uniform horizontal-to-vertical ratio appear and the size of the widget can be adjusted in each grid.

### Moving a widget

When you move the mouse cursor to the top of the widget, the cursor shape changes to ![Move icon](/img/ic-move-pointer.svg). At this time, you can move the widget by dragging with your left mouse button and move to the desired position.

### Deleting a widget

### Adding a widget

The widgets that can be added are fixed, but we plan to increase supports through future updates.
