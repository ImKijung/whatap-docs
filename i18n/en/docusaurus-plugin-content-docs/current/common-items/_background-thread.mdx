## Active Stack for Background Threads

Basically, the **active stack** means the stack of the thread in which transactions are being processed. You may need to analyze the stack for some background threads as well. At this time, the \*\* for the background thread can be obtained using the option. It is available in the Java agent 1.6.2 or later.

- If the value of `async_stack_enabled` is set to `true`, the function is enabled.

  ```ini title="whatap.conf"
  async_stack_enabled=false
  ```

- The stack dump interval depends on the foreground active stack setting.

  ```ini title="whatap.conf"
  active_stack_second=10
  ```

- When setting the target thread name, use `*` to specify the string pattern. 

  ```ini title="whatap.conf"
  async_thread_match=http*,abc*
  ```

    It identifies the stack dump target with the thread name. You can specify multiple matches using comma (,) as the delimiter.

- When the Top method of the stack is a class or method registered in `async_thread_parking`, it determines that the thread has been parked and does not generate a dump.

  ```ini title="whatap.conf"
  async_thread_parking_class=sun.misc.Unsafe
  async_thread_parking_method=park
  ```
