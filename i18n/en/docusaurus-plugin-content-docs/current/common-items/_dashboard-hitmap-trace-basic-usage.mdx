-   You can place, add, or hide desired columns to the front of the list. For more information, see [the following](#set-table-column).

-   If you drag another area in the **_Hitmap_** widget, a new trace analysis window appears. You can check it by comparing with the previous trace analysis window.

-   The transactions that are viewed can be shared with other users. With the transaction selected, copy the URL address on the trace analysis window and deliver it to another user. Any user who has received the URL address can quickly see the same items by entering the URL address in the browser address bar.
