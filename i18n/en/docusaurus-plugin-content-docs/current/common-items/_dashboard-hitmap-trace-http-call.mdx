### HTTP Calls

To see the count, time sum, average time, and such for HTTP calls, select the **_HTTP calls_** tab. If unnecessary external calls are repeatedly executed, it can be used as analytical information to determine whether the transaction delays are external or internal by finding the cases where the execution time takes longer compared to the low count.
