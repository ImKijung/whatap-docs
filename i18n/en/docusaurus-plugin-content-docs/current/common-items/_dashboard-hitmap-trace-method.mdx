### Methods

![Methods](/img/analysis-tx-method-summary.png)

To see only the method data, select the **_Methods_** tab. It displays the method name and step time for which tracing has been set on the agent. When unnecessary logics are repeatedly executed, it can be used as analysis data to improve the method logic by finding the case where the execution takes longer than the low count.

:::note

For more information about the agent configuration options on methods, see [the following](agent-transaction). Method tracing support may differ depending on the product in use.
