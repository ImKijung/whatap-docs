-   The area where the red circle (![Active stack icon](/img/ic-c-tx-active-stack.svg)) is located, is the moment when the active stack has been collected. If you select the red circle, the table list appears where the **_Active stacks_** button is located. If you click **_Active stack_**, you can check the step performed during the section.
