### Tree view {#anlaysis-trace-tree-view}

To see the transaction execution steps in a tree format, select the <Cmdname sid="TTL06127" className="uitext" /> tab. You can see the details of each transaction and its trace details, trace start time, step time, and call relationship. If you select each section of the diagram, the tree view of the step appears.

- <Cmdname sid="BTN06368" className="uitext" />: You can arrange the tree format at intervals by displaying the texts displayed in the execution data for each section in a single line.

- <Cmdname sid="BTN06369" className="uitext" />: All the texts displayed in the execution data for each section, appear by wrapping words.

- <Cmdname sid="BTN06327" className="uitext" />: The longest route can appear.

  - 8 seconds or more: <span class='etrs'>Excessive delay</span> state is distinguished in <span class='etrs'>red</span>.

  - Between 3 and 8 seconds: <span class='ov5ud10'>Delay</span> state is distinguished in <span class='ov5ud10'>orange</span>.

  - Less than 3 seconds: <span class='woer'>Normal</span> state is distinguished in <span class='woer'>blue</span>.

- ![Popup icon](/img/ic-popup.svg): A window appears where you can view SQL variables and HTTP queries. For more information, see [the following](#transaction-parameter).

:::note

In case of start and step times, the time differences caused by the transaction call environment are corrected on the screen through traces and mappings in the parent transactions. Accordingly, there may be differences from the actual time data.
