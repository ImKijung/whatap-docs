## Changing the lookup criteria

Select the chart area of <Cmdname sid="transaction_map" /> and then the button at the upper left to change the data lookup criteria.

- <Cmdname sid="elapsed" className="uitext" />: The data is searched based on the elapsed time of the executed transaction.

- <Cmdname sid="httpcTime" className="uitext" />: The data is searched based on the response time for HTTP calls.

- <Cmdname sid="sqlTime" className="uitext" />: The data is searched based on the SQL patch time.

If you select **_Error_** on the upper right of the chart area, you can view only the transactions with errors. If you drag a transaction on the chart in this state, the <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" /> window that displays a list of erroneous transactions. To view all transactions, select **_Total_**.
