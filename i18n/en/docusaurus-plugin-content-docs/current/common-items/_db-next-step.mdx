- **Checking the installation**

  If you have created a project, installed an agent, and applied all agent options, see the checklist in [the following](after-install-agent).

- **Installation troubleshooting**

  It provides various problems that may occur when installing the agent and specific instructions for resolving them. For more information, see [the following](troubleshooting).

- **Agent setting**

  It provides various features for monitoring by applying some options to the agent configuration file (_whatap.conf_). For more information, see [the following](agent-dbx-settings).

  To additionally monitor the database server resources, set more options in the additional agent (XOS). For more information, see [the following](agent-xos-settings).

- **Starting the monitoring**

  After configuring all settings, the agent starts collecting metrics data from the database server. First, check whether the monitoring data has been collected in <Cmdname sid="side_instanceList" className="uitext" />. For more information about <Cmdname sid="side_instanceList" className="uitext" />, see [the following](instance-list).
