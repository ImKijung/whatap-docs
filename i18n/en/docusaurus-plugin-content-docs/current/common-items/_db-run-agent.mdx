## Running the agent

Execute a shell script (or batch file) from the path where you have installed the agent.

<Tabs groupId='os'>

<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>

```bash
./start.sh
```

To use it like a daemon, execute the following command. However, it works only in the environment where **nohup** has been installed.

```bash
./startd.sh
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```bash
start.bat
```

You can set the service to automatically start the agent when the Windows system starts. See the following commands.

```bash
# In case of registering the service
install_WindowsService.bat create WhatapDBXAgent

# In case of deleting the service
install_WindowsService.bat delete WhatapDBXAgent
```

:::note

In **Control Panel** > **Windows Tools** > **Services** (services.msc), you can start or stop the **WhatapDBXAgent** service. Depending on the Windows version, the **service** path may differ.
