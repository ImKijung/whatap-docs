Home > Select Project > **_STAT/REPORT_** > **_SQL Statistics_**

Statistics are created based on the SQL execution count, execution time, and waiting time within the active sessions collected by the agent, and a list of top SQLs for the search period is provided. It provides a basis for analyzing frequently performed SQL performance through the average and maximum execution time.

For quick performance analysis, you can search top SQLs for each frequently analyzed category (DB, application, user, host). The main search criteria are as follows:

- **_execute count_**: Execution count of the SQL

- **_elapse sum (sec)_**: Total execution time (secs) of the SQL

- **_elapse avg (sec)_**: Average execution time (sec) of the SQL. It is the result of **elapse sum**/**execute count**.

- **_elapse max (sec)_**: Maximum execution time (sec) of the SQL

- **_elapse wait (sec)_**: Total waiting time (sec) of the SQL

- **_instance_**: Instance name
