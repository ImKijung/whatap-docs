-   If you select ![number 1](/img/number-01.png) **_Reference Date_**, ![number 2](/img/number-02.png) **_Comparison Date_**, and **_Instance_**, the data is automatically applied to all widgets based on the selected items.

-   To see the meaning of the metric displayed in the widget, select <span class='mark'>i</span> next to the name or see [the following](metrics-data-list).

-   To change the position with another widget, select and drag the upper part of the widget. However, the size of the widget cannot be changed.

-   The left of the ![number 3](/img/number-03.png) **_active sessions_** table displays the data for the **_reference date_**, and the right of the table displays the data for the **_comparison date_**.

-   In the ![number 3](/img/number-03.png) **_active sessions_** table, the text colors are changed black → <span class='slow'>orange</span> → <span class='vslow'>Red</span>, which means that the performance of the session is getting slower.
