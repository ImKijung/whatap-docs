### Deleting a metric

You can delete unnecessary metrics while multiple metrics have been set in the widget.

1. On the upper right of the widget to delete metrics from, select ![Configuration icon](/img/ico-setting.svg).

2. If the **_Metric Select_** window appears, select ![Delete icon](/img/ico-trash.svg) on the right of the metric to delete from the ![number 7](/img/number-07.png) area.

3. Select **_Save_** on the upper right of the screen.

:::note

At least one metric must be selected for a widget. You cannot delete all metrics in a widget.
