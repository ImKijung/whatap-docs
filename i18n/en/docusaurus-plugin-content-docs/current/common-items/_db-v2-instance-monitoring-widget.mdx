- When a specific time is selected in the widget, the **real-time inquiry** mode is stopped and the active sessions performed at the selected time zone appear in the ![number 4](/img/number-04.png) <Cmdname sid="active_sessions" className="uitext" /> table. After that, a button that allows you to view the data every 5 seconds appears on the <Cmdname sid="active_sessions" className="uitext" /> table.

  :::note

  - The selected time can be seen on the upper right of the <Cmdname sid="active_sessions" className="uitext" /> table.

  - In the <Cmdname sid="active_sessions" className="uitext" /> table list, the text colors are changed black → <span class='slow'>orange</span> → <span class='vslow'>Red</span>, which means that the performance of the session is getting slower.
