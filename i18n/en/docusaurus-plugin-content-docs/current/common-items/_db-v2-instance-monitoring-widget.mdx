### ![](/img/number-02.png) Graph chart section

![number3](/img/number-03.png) **_Default_** displays 16 metrics saved as presets as a graph chart widget. The horizontal axis of each widget is time, and the vertical axis is the metric number. To know the meaning of each metric, select <span class='mark'>i</span> next to the name or see [the following](metrics-data-list).

- To change the position with another widget, select and drag the upper part of the  widget. However, the size of the widget cannot be changed.

- When a specific time is selected in the widget, the **real-time inquiry** mode is stopped and the active sessions performed at the selected time zone appear in the ![number 4](/img/number-04.png) **_Active Sessions_** table. After that, a button that allows you to view the data every 5 seconds appears on the **_Active Sessions_** table.

  :::note

  - The selected time can be seen on the upper right of the **_Active Sessions_** table.

  - In the **_Active Sessions_** table list, the text colors are changed black → <span class='slow'>orange</span> → <span class='vslow'>Red</span>, which means that the performance of the session is getting slower.
