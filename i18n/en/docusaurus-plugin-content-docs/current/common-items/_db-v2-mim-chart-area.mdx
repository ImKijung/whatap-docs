## Learning about the main widgets {#about-widget}

The types of widgets that can be placed on the dashboard are as follows.

### XOS widgets

- **_[XOS] CPU_**

  You can see the CPU usages for each agent in real time.

- **_[XOS] Memory_**

  You can see the memory usages for each agent in real time.

- **_XOS Disk Usage_**

  Displays the disk utilizations, free sizes, and total sizes for each agent. If you select ![Icon](/img/ico-expander.svg) on the upper right of the widget, you can see them on a wider screen.

  :::tip

  If there is no data displayed, add the following settings to the _xos.conf_ file.

  ```ini title='xos.conf'
  # Off if the disk usage is 0; unit: second
  disk_usage_interval=60
  ```

### AWS RDS CloudWatch widgets

- **_[RDS] CPUUtilization_**

  You can see the CPU usages for each RDS DB instance in real time.

- **_[RDS] FreeableMemory_**

  You can see the memory usages for each RDS DB instance in real time.

- **_[RDS] FreeStorageSpace_**

  You can see the free storage space in the RDS database in real time.

:::note

For information on how to configure the agent for inquiry of AWS CloudWatch metrics, see [the following](agent-dbx-settings#using-aws-rds).

### Database widgets

- **_Active Sessions_**

  Displays a real-time chart for the number of sessions running queries.

<InDoc product='postgresql'>

- **_DML Tuples_**

  Displays a real-time chart for the number of statements run for DML (Data Manipulation Language).

</InDoc>

<InDoc product='mysql'>

- **_Questions_**

  Number of commands executed by the MySQL server. It differs from the Queries in that it does not count commands executed in a stored program.

</InDoc>

- **_Slow Query_**

  Displays a real-time chart for slow queries for each time zone. If you drag a specific part of the chart, the **_Slow Query List_** appears. You can enlarge or reduce the range of the vertical axis by selecting ![Up arrow icon](/img/up-arrow.svg) or ![Down arrow icon](/img/down-arrow.svg).

<InDoc product="postgresql">

- **_Logical I/O_**

  The `blks_hit` metric provides a real-time chart of the total number of cases where disk blocks were found in the buffer cache and does not require reading.

</InDoc>

<InDoc product="mysql">

- **_Logical I/O_**

  It displays the number of logical read requests including physical reads on the real-time chart. You can calculate the `Innodb buffer pool hit` percentage as follows, and 90% or higher is recommended. If Hit Ratio is low, consider increasing the `Innodb_buffer_pool_size`.

  > `Buffer Hit Ratio` = (1 - (`Innodb_buffer_pool_reads`/`Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests`)) \* 100

</InDoc>

- **_SQL Elapse Map_**

  Displays a real-time chart for the elapsed times of running queries. If you drag a specific part of the chart, the **_Query List_** appears. You can enlarge or reduce the range of the vertical axis by selecting ![Up arrow icon](/img/up-arrow.svg) or ![Down arrow icon](/img/down-arrow.svg).

  :::note

  The execution times of queries are calculated after collecting active sessions. Therefore, depending on the active session collection cycle, there may be a margin of error. See the following figure. The execution times of SQL queries that have ended within the collection cycle are not calculated. A shorter collection cycle may decrease the margin of error, but considering the database load, it is typically set to 5 seconds. It is useful for monitoring long-running queries. The same is true for the data in **_SQL statistics_**.

- **_Lock Wait Sessions_**

  Displays a real-time chart for queued counts to acquire the row lock.

<InDoc product='postgresql'>

- **_Commit Count_**

  Displays a real-time chart for the counts of committed transactions.

</InDoc>

<InDoc product='mysql'>

- **_Commit_**

  Displays a real-time chart for the counts of committed transactions.

</InDoc>

- **_Replication Delay_**

  Displays a real-time chart for the delayed times that are reflected in the replication DB in case of the replication structure.

- **_Physical I/O_**

  Displays a real-time chart for the data read counts in the physical disks.

<InDoc product='postgresql'>

- **_Wait Event_**

  If the backend process is currently queued, you can check the queued event names and counts. Hover your mouse over the chart to see the information through a tooltip.

</InDoc>

<InDoc product='mysql'>

- **_Select Full Join_**

  When joining one or more tables (`JOIN`), the number of full scans for driven tables without using any index appears in a real-time chart.

- **_Tmp Tables_**

  Displays a real-time chart for internal temporary table counts created by the server during command execution for each instance.
