### ![](/img/number-01.png) Instance

It is a list of instances to which the agent was connected through installation. The colors of instances match the ones on the graph chart in the middle of the screen. If the color changes to gray when an instance is selected, it is in the deselected state. The data of the instances that have been deselected from each metric and graph chart, are excluded.
