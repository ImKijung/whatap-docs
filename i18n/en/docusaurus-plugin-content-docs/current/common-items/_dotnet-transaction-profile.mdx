- **trace_normalize_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  It enables the function to parse and normalize transaction URLs.

  :::note

  If the value is changed to `false`, it disables the path parameter parsing. In this case, it is recommended to temporarily use the setting only for debugging purposes because the statistical data is less meaningful.

  :::

- **trace_normalize_urls** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `NONE`

  Set transaction URL patterns to normalize. It deletes the path parameter after parsing the call URL patterns.

  :::note

  For example, if declared as `/a/{v}/b`, `a/123/b` is replaced by `a/{v}/b`. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter. A complement is required after arranging substitution patterns.
