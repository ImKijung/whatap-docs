It is recommended to use a plug-in only if you are familiar with it.

:::

Create the _plugin_ folder under the _WHATAP_HOME_ path and move to _plugin_. Create the _AppServiceStart.x_ file with the `vi` command.

![Plugin usage example](https://img.whatap.io/media/agent_python/data/app_start_plug.png)

If you type `println("test");` and save it, you can see that the string "test" is displayed on the screen. After checking it, extract data from the parameter. 

In the following example, `HashMap` is passed as a parameter, and this `HashMap` contains the key called 'url'.

```javascript title=JAVA
Object url =((java.util.HashMap)$point.getArgs()[0]).get("url");
$ctx.service((String)url);
//println("url="+url);
```

If you create a plugin like this, you can change the transaction name.
