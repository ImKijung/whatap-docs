1. Set the transaction start point as follows: 

   ```ini title="whatap.conf"
   hook_service_patterns=com.virtual.web.SimulaNonHttp.process
   ```

2. Restart the application. 

The `process()` method becomes the **end point** of a new transaction.

:::note

For the `hook_service_patterns` option, wildcard characters cannot be used. To set multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.
