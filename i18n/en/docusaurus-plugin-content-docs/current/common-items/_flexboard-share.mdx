The Flex board can be shared or reused by the users with other accounts.

## Sharing the Flex board with members

You can share the created Flex board to see the same dashboard with other users. This allows the work to be shared. If you modify the dashboard you shared, the other users can see the changed dashboard. This feature is available only in Home > **_Flex Board_**.

1. Select ![Share icon](/img/ico-flexboard-share.svg) of the dashboard you want to share from **_Dashboard list_** in **_Flex Board_**.
