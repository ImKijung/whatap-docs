## Agent CONFIG.

Create the _whatap.conf_ file in which WhaTap's access key and server IP address have been set in the user application execution path. 

```docker title='whatap.conf'
RUN echo "accesskey={액세스 키}" >> whatap.conf
RUN echo "whatap.server.host={수집 서버 IP 주소}" >> whatap.conf
```

If you use a specific path, you can set it with the `WATAP_HOME` environment variable.

### Setting the `WHATAP_HOME` variable

You can set the _whatap.conf_ path as the `WHATAP_HOME` variable. Create the `WHATAP_HOME` path first.

```bash
mkdir ./whatap_home
echo "license={액세스 키}" >> ./whatap_home/whatap.conf
echo "whatap.server.host={수집 서버 IP 주소}" >> ./whatap_home/whatap.conf

# run application
WHATAP_HOME=./whatap_home ./app
```
