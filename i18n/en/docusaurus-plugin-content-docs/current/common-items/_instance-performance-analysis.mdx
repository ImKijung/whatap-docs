- <Cmdname sid="agent_configuration" className="uitext" />

  You can add, modify, or delete the agent configuration options without directly modifying the _whatap.conf_ file located on the monitored server.

  :::info

  For the agent configuration, it is recommended to use the <Cmdname sid="management" className="uitext" /> > <Cmdname sid="agent_configuration" className="uitext" /> menu that has improved the usability and functionality. On the upper right of the screen, select <Cmdname sid="new_agents_setting" className="uitext" />. For more information, see [the following](set-agent#set-agent-service).

### Application-related items

- <Cmdname sid="boot_env" className="uitext" />

  You can view environment variables for application execution.

<InDoc product="java">

- <Cmdname sid="heap_histogram" className="uitext" />

  You can view the status of heap occupied objects (sizes for each object in heap memory) in the memory of the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).

  :::note

  Java versions 6 to 8 support basic functions without the JVM options. However, for some Java versions, the JVM options must be applied as follows:

  - Java 9 to Java 15

    ```bash
    -Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf=true
    ```

    ```bash title="example"
    java -javaagent:{WHATAP_HOME}/whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar -Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf=true -jar {application.jar}
    ```

  - Java 16 or later

    ```bash
    -Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf=true
    --add-opens=jdk.attach/sun.tools.attach=ALL-UNNAMED
    ```

    ```bash title="example"
    java -javaagent:{WHATAP_HOME}/whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar -Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf=true --add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=jdk.attach/sun.tools.attach=ALL-UNNAMED -jar {application.jar}
    ```

  - It does not support Java 5 or earlier and IBM Java.
