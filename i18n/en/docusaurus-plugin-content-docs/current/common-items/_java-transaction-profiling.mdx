- **profile_step_normal_count** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `1000`

  Set the maximum step count for tracing transactions.

- **profile_step_heavy_count** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `1020`

  In case of heavy steps, even if they exceed the default step count in the trace, the set value is recorded.

- **profile_step_max_count** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `1024`

  Set the maximum number of trace steps. If the number of collected trace steps exceeds this value, all steps collected later are ignored. If `profile_step_heavy_count` is set up to 1000, active stacks are collected as many as `profile_step_max_count`.

- **profile_step_heavy_time** <span class='type'>MiliSecond</span>

  Default `100`

  Set the criterion of heavy steps. If the execution time is greater than the set value and `profile_step_normal_count` is exceeded, recording is made as many as `profile_step_heavy_count`.

- **active_stack_count** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `100`

  Set the maximum number of active stacks to collect in transactions.

- **profile_method_resource_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  When collecting method steps from the transaction trace, the CPU and memory usages in the step is traced.

- **profile_position_method** <span class='type'>String</span>

  It records the stack traces that run the set methods.

- **profile_position_depth** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `50`

  Set the maximum number of lines when recording stack traces for position tracing.

- **trace_error_callstack_depth** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `50`

  Set the maximum number of stack trace lines collected when errors occur.

- **trace_active_callstack_depth** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `50`

  Set the maximum number of stack trace lines collected by active stacks.

- **hook_method_patterns** <span class='type'>String</span>

  It sets the method to measure the response time. Class full names and methods are separated by the period (.) as the delimiter, and asterisk (\*) can be used as the wildcard. In case of multiple items, comma (,) is used as the delimiter.

  ```ini title='whatap.conf'
  hook_method_patterns=a.b.C1.*
  ```

  :::note

  - The methods registered through this option can be checked through the Method step in <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" /> or <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window.

  - It is recommended to apply it locally as much as possible. If applied extensively, it may cause performance degradation in applications.

  :::

- **hook_method_supers** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Set the super class when measuring the response time of the method inherited from a specific class. It sets the full name of the class. Multiple items are separated with comma (,).

  ```ini title='whatap.conf'
  hook_method_supers=a.b.C1
  ```

- **hook_method_interfaces** <span class='type'>String</span>

  When measuring the response time of the method that implements a specific interface, it sets the interface. It sets the full name of the interface. Multiple items are separated with comma (,).

- **hook_method_ignore_classes** <span class='type'>String</span>

  When setting a method trace, it sets the classes to exclude from the trace.

- **hook_method_access_public_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  When setting a method trace, it sets whether or not to treat only the public methods as separate targets.

- **hook_method_access_private_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  When setting a method trace, it sets whether or not to treat only the private methods as separate targets.

- **hook_method_access_protected_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  When setting a method trace, it sets whether or not to treat only the protected methods as separate targets.

- **hook_method_access_none_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  When setting a method trace, it sets whether or not to treat only the no access indicated methods as separate targets.

- **stacklog_socket_port** <span class='type'>TCP_PortNumber</span>

  Default `0`

  If the destination TCP port has been set, the stack trace is recorded as an agent log at the time of Socket.connect(). It can be used when tracing DB connections, HTTPC connections, and such that are not checked by default settings.

  :::caution

  Stack traces are recorded whenever the set destination is connected. It may cause performance degradation. It must be used temporarily only in the agents selected for debugging purposes.

  Example of DB connection tracing: `stacklog_socket_port=1521`

  :::

- **trace_concern_error_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  It sets whether or not to collect detailed traces with errors, regardless of the `trace_basetime` or `profile_basetime` option.
