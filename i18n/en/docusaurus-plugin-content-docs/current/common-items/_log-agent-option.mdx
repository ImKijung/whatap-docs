**If the agent option is set**, the log levels are collected and the colors for each log level appear as follows:

:::note 

**Setting the agent options**

- The agent options are as follows: 

  ```ini
  # whatap.conf
  weaving=log4j-2.17
  weaving=logback-1.2.8
  ```

- In Java agent 2.2.22 or later, it can be used when setting log4j-2.17 or logback-1.2.8 in the weaving setting. It is required to restart the agent.

- The log level is determined based on the `level` and `type` among the parsed keywords. When there are keys parsed as `level` and `type`, and the parsed values have <span class='vslow'>FATAL</span>, <span class='vslow'>CRITICAL</span>, <span class=' vslow'>ERROR</span>, <span class='slow'>WARN</span>, <span class='slow'>WARNING</span>, and <span class='mstop'>INFO</span>, the log level color appears.
