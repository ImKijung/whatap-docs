In **_Log Trend_**, you can check the occurrence pattern of a specific error type through the number of logs classified by type, and check detailed log data by hour. A highlight feature allows you to quickly identify the desired logs. You can search the trend of logs collected by category. {@include: ../common-items/_log-ui-main-term.mdx}

## Request Data

-   If the scroll reaches the bottom, the next data is retrieved.
-   In ![number-s](/img/number-01.png), specify the **_time_** and collection unit, **_category_**, of the log data to be searched.
-   If the **_category_** is changed, the logs that correspond to the selected category are searched. You can see the logs in ![number-s](/img/number-02.png) bar chart and ![number-s](/img/number-03.png) log table.
-   If you click a bar in ![number-s](/img/number-02.png) bar chart, the logs are viewed that correspond to the time range of the bar. 
-   ![number-s](/img/number-03.png) You can see the total number of logs viewed from the upper left of the log table.
-   ![number-s](/img/number-04.png) In Side menu, you can see the logs filtered by tags. Up to two search keys can be selected, and multiple search values can be selected.

## Checking the log content

{@include: ../common-items/_log-ui-log-content.mdx} 

-   ![number-s](/img/number-03.png) For each row (log) of the log table, the ![Icon](/img/ic-caret-right.svg) **_More_** button exists. If you select the ![Icon](/img/ic-caret-right.svg) **_More_** button, you can check the entire content of the log like ![number-s](/img/number-05.png).

## Viewing the logs with a chart

![Log trends bar chart sc](/img/log-trend-bar.png)

-   You can click a ![icon](/img/char-a.svg) desired time on the bar chart to view the logs in the period of time.

-   You can use the ![b icon](/img/char-b.svg) time selection option on the upper left of the log table under the bar chart to further refine your log search in the selected time zone:

    -   1min: interval (spacing between bars on the chart)

    -   Select a time option: Time zone whose time range is divided into 6 segments
