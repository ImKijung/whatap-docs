**Content search key**

-   The content search key searches the bodies of unindexed logs. For example, if you enter `content *ERROR*`, the logs containing `ERROR` are searched among the log bodies. 

-   If you do not know which keywords need to be used for indexing, use the content search keys to identify the logs containing problematic keywords. Afterwards, you can improve the search performance by setting a parser with the keyword through the log parser settings in **_Log setting_** and creating indexes.
