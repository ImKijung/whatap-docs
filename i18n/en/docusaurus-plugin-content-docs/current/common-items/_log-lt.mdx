In **_Live Tail_**, you can easily check the log data stream on the monitoring screen without accessing the server console. You can select necessary logs from numerous logs and quickly recognize the desired logs through the highlight function. 

<ImgLang img='log-live-tail.png' desc='Live tail'/>

In **_Live Tail_**, complex logs can be easily accessed. You can search the logs in real time by using the functions such as **_Filter_** or **_Highlight_**, if necessary. The log data search cycle is 2 seconds. {@include: ../common-items/_log-ui-main-term.mdx}

### Apply Filter

{@include: ../common-items/_log-filter-apply2.mdx}

:::note

- You cannot enter a `category` with the **_Live Tail_** `search key`.

- The expression under the entered filter value is a preview of the filter expression for querying the log data. 

:::

### Applying non-parsing keyword filters

You can search the logs containing keywords that have not been parsed, or for which no index has been created. In this case, all logs in the specified range are fully scanned. Therefore, the search speed may be slower compared to the indexed key. For standardized log data, it is recommended to search using the index key through **_Log parser setting_**.

<ImgLang img='log-filter-search.png' desc='Applying non-parsing keyword filters'/>

1. Select **_Category_**. 

2. In the **_Filter_** field, enter a desired keyword for a search after leaving spaces on the `content` basis. 

   > e.g. `content *select*`

3. Click ![Icon](/img/ic-search.svg) **_Search_** to view the logs.

:::note 

**Setting the parser and categories**

- For more information about the parser configuration, see [the following](log-parser.mdx/). 

- In case of **_Live Tail_**, all logs can be viewed. Thus, the category is not required to be specified.

### Modifying the filter

{@include: ../common-items/_log-filter-modify.mdx} 

### Search Key

In the following image, the blue boxed part is the search key for parsing. The search key can be set by registering the parsing logic in **_Log parser setting_** under **_Log setting_**.

## ![](/img/number-02.png) Content highlight area

The highlight function is provided to easily identify the desired keywords among the log data. 

<ImgLang img='log-content-search-highlight.png' desc='Content highlight'/>

- In the ![Leader line a](/img/char-a.svg) keyword field, enter a keyword to highlight, and then click ![Search icon](/img/ic-search.svg)**_Search_**.

  > e.g. `select`

- As shown in the example, the keyword within the content is highlighted in the ![Leader line b](/img/char-b.svg) log list. 

- You can filter by single or multiple keywords.

- If you select ![Full screen icon](/img/ic-fullscreen.svg) **_Full screen_**, the **_logs_** and **_timestamps_** appear in the full screen. 

### Multi-keyword condition

When highlighting with multiple keywords, write as follows:

| String to input       | Description                                                           | Result            |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `a b c`               | Separate each keyword with a space.                                   | a, b, c           |
| `"Whatap is good."`   | To include spaces in keywords, wrap them in '`'` or `""`.             | Whatap is good.   |
| `"Whatap\\ is good."` | If `\` is included in the keyword surrounded by "", enter it as `\\`. | Whatap\\ is good. |

### Setting the highlight color

By selecting ![Icon](/img/ic-highlight.svg) **_Highlight_**, you can set the keyword and its color for highlighting. 

<ImgLang img='log-lt-highlight.png' desc='Live tail highlight'/>

- In addition, enter the keyword to set the color for. 

- If you click **_Color_** on the left of the input field, available colors appear. 

- Basically, different highlighting by the level (<span class='logwr'>WARN</span>, <span class='loger'>ERROR</span>, <span class='logft'>FATAL</span>) is applied. 

- The settings are saved in **Project Rules**.  

### Table settings

- Right of the ![number-s](/img/number-02.png) area: {@include: ../common-items/_log-ui-table-setting.mdx} 

<!-- whatap is good~whatap is the best -->
