## What is the metrics?

WhaTap collects data from monitoring targets and provides them to users. The data collected from agents is called **metrics**.

**Metrics** consists of the following components:

-   **_Category_**: A group of related metrics.
-   **_Tags_**: Data containing unique identifiers to find the targets to collect.
-   **_Fields_**: Metrics collected from the agent.
-   **_Time_**: Time when the metric has been collected.
-   **_Oid_**: Unique number of the agent that has collected metrics.
-   **_oname_**: Unique name of the agent that has collected metrics.

For example, the `app_counter` is a **_category_** that contains data for transactions. In this case, you can view the transaction related metrics by querying the `app_counter` **_category_**.

Looking at the `app_counter` sample data, you can see that **_Tags_** and **_Fields_** have been collected from both agents, `-1143239575` (`demo-8101`) and `-877561626` (`demo-8109`) at the same time (2023-04-06 05:00:00).

## Viewing the metrics chart

**_Project Menu_** > **_Analysis_** > **_Metrics Chart_**

After selecting the project in **_Project List_**, select **_Metrics Chart_** from **_Analyze_**. You can view the metric data collected from the monitoring target as a chart.

-   **_Time_** to view (**Required**)
-   **_Metric_** to view (**Required**)
-   **_Monitoring targets_** to view (**_Optional_**, if nothing is selected, all items are applied)

The metrics chart screen example displays the metrics (`TPS`) collected from the monitoring targets, `-1143239575` (`demo-8101`) and `-877561626` (`demo-8109`) at the selected time as a chart. At this time, the collection server uses the `app_counter` category metric, which has the selected metric value (`TPS`) as a field.
