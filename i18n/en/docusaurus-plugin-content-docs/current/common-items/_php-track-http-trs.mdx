- **whatap.trace_normalize_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  It enables the function to convert and normalize transaction URLs.

- **whatap.trace_normalize_urls** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Set the target URL to transform and normalize. It deletes the path parameter by transforming the call URL patterns. 

  :::note

  For example, if it is set as `/a/{v}/b`, the called transaction URLs are transformed to the `/a/{v}/b` format. To register multiple items, comma (,) is used as the delimiter.

  :::

- **whatap.trace_ignore_url_set** <span class='type'>String</span>

  If a specific URL is set, the corresponding transactions are excluded from tracing. The set URLs are not displayed in the transaction list because they do not collect transaction data. Set URLs to exclude from transaction tracing. To set multiple items, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

  :::note

  The URLs registered through this option are excluded from the <Cmdname sid="side_hitmap" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" />, or <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window for collection.

  :::

- **whatap.trace_ignore_url_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

  It sets URL prefixes to exclude from the transaction tracing.

  :::note

  The URLs registered through this option are excluded from the <Cmdname sid="side_hitmap" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" />, or <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window for collection.

- **whatap.profile_http_header_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  It is used to record the HTTP headers in the trace history.

- **whatap.profile_http_header_ignore_keys** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `host,accept,user-agent,referer, accept-language, connection`

  It is used to record HTTP headers in the profile details. The set HTTP header names are excluded from collection, and they are marked with "#."

- **whatap.profile_http_parameter_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span><ScrollToLink anchor='profile_http_parameter' />

  Default `false`

  It is used to record HTTP parameters in the trace history. The parameters can be viewed by entering a separate security key.

  The name and value of the text type are collected among Get and Post parameters. Up to 40 items (20 Gets, 20 Posts) are collected, and parameter names and values are collected up to 256 bytes.

  Parameter data is transferred after being encrypted separately, and can be viewed by decrypting with the key(`paramkey`) in _/usr/whatap/php/security.conf_ of the application server.

  :::note

  - <code class="my">PHP agent v2.8.0 or later</code>: The security key is set to 6 characters (`paramkey`) in the `WHATAP_HOME`*/security.conf* file where the *whatap.ini* file is located.

  - <code class="my">Below PHP agent v2.8.0</code>: The security key is set to 6 characters within the `WHATAP_HOME`*/paramkey.txt* file where the *whatap.ini* file is located. If the *paramkey.txt* file does not exist, it is automatically created with a random value.

  :::

- **whatap.profile_http_parameter_url_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `/`

  It is used to define the prefix of URL to record HTTP parameters in the trace details.

- **whatap.profile_http_host_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  The transation host is output. If the value is `false`, only the URI is recorded in the URL of a transaction. If the value is `true`, the output has the format of `/xxx.aaa.com/URL`.

- **whatap.ignore_http_method** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Transactions requested by the specified HTTP method are not collected. To set multiple items, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

  ```ini title="whatap.ini"
  # e.g. tracing the transactions whose http_method is OPTIONS or HEAD
  ignore_http_method=PATCH,TRACE

  # e.g. ignoring the transactions whose http_method is OPTIONS or HEAD
  ignore_http_method=OPTIONS,HEAD
  ```

  :::note

  The HTTP methods registered through this option are excluded from the <Cmdname sid="side_hitmap" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" />, or <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window for collection.
