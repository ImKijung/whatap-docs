Report is a document that reports the service usage status and failure records for individual projects. The persons in charge of service monitoring share the status report with the people of related departments.

The monitoring data analysis is important because it serves as a metric for determining the direction of improvement. However, it is cumbersome to aggregate and document data from multiple dashboards.  

WhaTap's <Cmdname sid="report" className="uitext" /> menu supports **automated report creation**. Through the <Cmdname sid="report" className="uitext" /> menu, you can create weekly reports, share reports at the set times, and manage various templates.

- <Cmdname sid="report" className="uitext" /> is the menu that generates a report for a single project. You can select a project and then enter the <Cmdname sid="report" className="uitext" /> menu in the side menu.

- <Cmdname sid="integrated_report" className="uitext" /> is the menu to generate a report for multiple projects. You can enter it from the side menu on the Home screen without selecting a project.
