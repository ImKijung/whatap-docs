### Selecting a node type

![Node selection](/img/npm-dashboard-topology-select-node.png)

You can select a node type displayed on the chart. Each corresponds to a single tag. Tags are collected depending on the **tagRule** options you set in the _tagRule.yaml_ file. Nodes can be represented as **_process type_**, **_application_**, or a combination of the two.

:::note

For more information about the **tagRule** options, see [the following](set-tagrule).
