## Setting the events by item

You can set the following events.

-   **_Server CPU_**, **_Server Memory_**, **_Server Disk_**

    A notification is sent when the usages of each item reach the threshold set in **_Condition (%)_**.

-   **_Active Transaction_**

    If the number of active transactions continues to exceed the threshold set in **_Condition (Count)_**, the corresponding alert is sent. The default value of occurrence is 100.

-   **_Transaction Error_**

    It indicates a transaction that has not been performed normally. If the error count continues to exceed the threshold set in **_Condition (Count)_**, the corresponding alert is sent. The collection cycle is 5 seconds.

-   **_Transaction Response Time_**

    Check with the transaction end time. For example, if the **_count_** of transactions that are above the **_response time_** threshold (**10** seconds) exceeds **10**, and this state **continues** for **5** seconds, the corresponding alert is sent.
