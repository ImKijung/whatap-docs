## Alert Repetition Setting{#escalation}

If the symptom is not resolved since the alert occurrence time, you can set the notification repetition interval from the initial alert occurrence time. For example, to repeat an alert after 0 minutes (immediately), 1 hour, and 1 day from the alert occurrence time, enter `0,1H,1D` in the <Cmdname sid="TTL06149" className="uitext" /> column.

:::note

- This function targets all events for the <span class='vslow'>Critical</span> (or <Cmdname sid="fatal" className="vslow" /> class). See the <Cmdname sid="level" className="uitext" /> item set for adding an event.

- If you omit the unit such as **M**: Minute, **H**: Hour, **D**: Day, you can set the time in minutes.

- If <Cmdname sid="save" className="uitext" /> is not selected, configuration cannot be finished.

- Enter the value in the following format: number or number + unit (**M**, **H**, **D**). If the input is wrong, the corresponding message appears.
