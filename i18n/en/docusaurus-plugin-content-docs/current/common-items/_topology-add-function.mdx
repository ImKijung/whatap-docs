-   Hover your mouse over a specific node to highlight the node, related nodes, and link data.
-   Entry of the keyword allows you to keep the selection of the desired node. The highlighted state is kept even when the topology is updated.

## Using the node selection function

Select **_Node Selection_**. On the right of the screen, you can see the projects, DB calls, and outbound call nodes that are grouped on a diagram. 

<ImgLang img='topology-select-node.png' desc='Select node' />

If you select a sub node in the diagram on the right, the highlight filter is applied to the node on the topology screen to the left.

<ImgLang img='topology-select-node-agent.png' desc='Select node' />

On the screen to the right, you can use the following functions.

-   Zoon In/Out
-   Dragging
-   Applying the highlight filter when clicking the subordinate node
-   Hiding or displaying the subordinate node when clicking the upper node

To cancel the highlight filtering, delete the agent name in the keyword field.

-   **_Load Position_**: The position of a node is restored to the point when the position was saved.
-   **_Clear Position_**: The node position is initialized.
