It describes additional functions available in the Topology menu.

## Highlight filter

This function highlights the related nodes of a selected node. Complex relationships between numerous nodes can be easily verified with the topology.

<ImgLang img='topology-highlight.png' desc='Highlight Filter' />

-   Hover your mouse over a specific node to highlight the node, related nodes, and link data.
-   Entry of the keyword allows you to keep the selection of the desired node. The highlighted state is kept even when the topology is updated.

## Using the node selection function

On the lower right of the screen, double-click the **_Node Selection (Double Click)_** box. In **_Node Selection_**, click the sub-node on the right to apply the highlight filter.

In this chart, the projects, DB calls, and outbound call nodes are grouped to provide with a diagram, and in **_Node Selection_**, click a subordinate node on the right to apply the node name to the highlight filter.

If you click **_Node Selection_**, you can use the following functions:

-   Zoon In/Out
-   Dragging
-   Applying the highlight filter when clicking the subordinate node
-   Hiding or displaying the subordinate node when clicking the upper node

If you do not use the highlight filter with **_Node Selection_**, double-click the outer dotted line or double-click **_Hide Node Selection (Double Click)_**.

:::note

According to the menu, the location of **_Node Selection_** may differ. In **_Application Topology_**, the menus are provided with **_Node Selection_**.

## Context menus

Context menus appear when you right-click on a node in the topology. They provide the menus such as links to go to the application monitoring dashboard.

:::note

The menus such as **_Container Map_**, **_Node Resource_**, and **_Container Resource_** are available only in Container Monitoring.

## Saving and restoring the node positions

On the topology, the position of a node in the chart can be changed by dragging with the left mouse button. The position of the changed node is maintained even if you enter another menu and then return to the topology screen.

-   **_Save Position_**: The position of a changed node can be saved.
-   **_Load Position_**: The position of a node is restored to the point when the position was saved.
-   **_Clear Position_**: The node position is initialized.

:::note

-   The node position menu may not be supported depending on the topology menu.
-   The position data of the changed node is stored in the local storage of the web browser. The changed node position is not applied to the screens of other users.

## Assigning and removing the alias

You can set the alias of the node through **_Node Selection_** at the lower right of the topology screen.

1.  Double-click **_Node Selection (Double Click)_**.

2.  Go to the node to alias and right-click on it.

3.  When the alias input field appears, enter the alias and then press Enter.

The alias data is saved. The alias saved at the time of retrieving the chart data is applied.

To remove the saved alias, on the topology menu screen, select **_Reset Alias_**. The saved alias data is deleted. It is applied to the screen at the time when the chart data is newly retrieved.
