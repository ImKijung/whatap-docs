-   **profile_basetime** <span class='type'>MiliSecond</span>

    Default `500`

    Set the minimum response time to collect trace details. The trace data is not collected, if a transaction is terminated within the set value. The first URL called in every 5 minutes and the erroneous profile data are collected.

    :::note

    To collect errors regardless of the `profile_basetime` option, set the `profile_concern_error_enabled` option to `true`. If set to the default value of `false`, errors are sampled.
