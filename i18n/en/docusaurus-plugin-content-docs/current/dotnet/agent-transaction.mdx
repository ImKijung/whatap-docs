The agent traces the transaction performance and provides the following configurable options.

### Transaction Tracing

{@include: ../common-items/_dotnet-transaction-profile.mdx}

### Transaction tracing

-   **trace_active_transaction_slow_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span><br/> Default `3000`<br/>
    In the active transaction arc equalizer graph on the dashboard that checks collected data, specify the criteria for the transaction response time that can be recorded as a slow section. If the transaction response time exceeds the set time, the number of slow active transactions is included.

-   **trace_active_transaction_very_slow_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span><br/> Default `8000`<br/>
    In the active transaction arc equalizer graph on the dashboard that checks collected data, specify the criteria for the transaction response time that can be recorded as a very slow section. If the transaction response time exceeds the set time, the number of very slow active transactions is included.

-   **trace_active_transaction_lost_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span><br/>Default `30000`<br/>
    Timeout waiting for a transaction to end. If a transaction does not end within 5 minutes, no further transaction data is collected. You can see `Lost Connection` in the transaction trace information.

### 멀티 트랜잭션 추적

**mtrace_spec** <span class='type'>String</span><br/>
기본값: `v1`<br/>현재 인스턴스의 애플리케이션 버전을 설정합니다. 임의의 문자열을 입력할 수 있습니다. 이 데이터는 호출 통계를 위해 이용합니다.
