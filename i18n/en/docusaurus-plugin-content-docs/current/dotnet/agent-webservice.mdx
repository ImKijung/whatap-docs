You can trace web services in the .NET application servers.

-   **webservice_method_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    If the value has been set to `true`, web services can be traced. 

    :::note

    To apply the set values, restart IIS.

    :::

-   **webservice_method_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Enter the name of the method to be traced along with the namespace. Because web services cannot be directly traced, directly enter the method that has used the web services as a trace target.

    See the following example:

    ```ini title='whatap.conf'
    webservice_method_prefix=Test.Demo, WebServiceDemo.WebService.
    ```

    :::caution

    -   The methods that meet the conditions are traced even if they do not use web services. However, if any methods do not use web services, when an error occurs, the error may not be detected and the transaction can remain unfinished.

    -   If you enter just the class to which the method belongs, all methods within that class are to be traced.

    :::

    :::note

    To apply the set values, restart IIS.

    :::

-   **webservice_method_timeout** <span class='type'>millisecond</span>

    Default `30000`

    If exception handling is not performed within Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and web services, you cannot know the time when a transaction ended. For such cases, the timeout of WCF and web services occurs by default after 30 seconds. You can adjust the timeout by changing the option value.
