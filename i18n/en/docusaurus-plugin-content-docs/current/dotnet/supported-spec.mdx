## How to analyze the server support environment

### Downloading the analysis tools{#download-tools}

If you are not familiar with the supported environment of the server to install the agent on, download the analysis tools through the following links.

-   [https://repo.whatap.io/windows/WhaTapDotnetScan.exe](https://repo.whatap.io/windows/WhaTapDotnetScan.exe)

-   [https://repo.whatap.io/windows/WhaTapDotnetScan.zip](https://repo.whatap.io/windows/WhaTapDotnetScan.zip)

### Using the analysis tools{#use-tools}

1.  Run the downloaded analysis tools.

2.  Click ![number 1](/img/number-01.png) **Analysis** (**Scan**).

3.  In the ![number 2](/img/number-02.png) area, check whether the Windows server version is 2012 or later.

4.  In the ![number 3](/img/number-03.png) area, check whether the versions are **IIS 8.0** or later, and **.NET Framework 4.5** or later.

5.  Check that the **.NET Framework** version appears as v4.0 for each site installed in IIS.

    ![](/img/apm-dotnet-analystic-env-03.png)

    ![Number 5](/img/number-05.png) is the supported range, but there is no _web.config_ file. In this case, the agent does not work because they are the sites for ASP, PHP, and such that do not use **.NET**.

:::note

-   **.NET Framework** supports up to the version 4.8.1.

-   **Core**, **.NET 5**, or later is not supported. The **.NET Core** versions are under development.

:::

### Checking the user's application version

Even if the server environment satisfies the supported version, the .NET monitoring is not supported when the user's application has been developed as a **.NET Core** version instead of **.NET Framework**.

The user's application version can be seen in the **IIS Manager** as follows.

![IIS Manager](/img/apm-dotnet-application-pool.png)

In **IIS Manager**, click **Application Pools**. In the **Application Pools** list, check that **.NET** of the pool for your available application is the version 4.0.
