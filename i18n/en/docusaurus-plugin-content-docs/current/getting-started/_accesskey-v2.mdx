## Checking the access key{#check-accesskey}

The **access key** is the unique ID to enable the WhaTap service.  

In the installation guide section, select <cmdname sid="issue_project_access_key" className="uitext" />. After the **access key** has been issued automatically, proceed to the next step.

:::caution

-   If the **access key** is invalid, use of the service is restricted. Through ![Chat Contact icon](/img/ico-help.svg) <cmdname sid="chat_contact" className="uitext" /> on the upper right of the screen, the service can be renewed or extended.

-   The **access key** cannot be duplicated for other projects and separate access keys are required also in the **namespace project**.
