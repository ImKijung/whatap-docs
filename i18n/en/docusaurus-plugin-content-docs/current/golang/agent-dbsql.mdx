-   **trace_sql_normalize_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    It enables the function to normalize any SQL statements by extracting the literal part from each SQL statement. The literal part is denoted with "#."

-   **profile_sql_param_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    It is used to record SQL parameters in the transaction trace details. The parameters can be viewed by entering a separate security key.

    :::note

    The security key is set to 6 characters within the `WHATAP_HOME`_/paramkey.txt_ file where the _whatap.conf_ file is located. If the _paramkey.txt_ file does not exist, it is automatically created with a random value.
