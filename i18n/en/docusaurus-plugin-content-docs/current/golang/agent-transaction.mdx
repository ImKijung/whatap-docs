## Transaction Tracing

-   **profile_step_normal_count** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `1000`

    Set the maximum step count for tracing transactions.

-   **profile_step_max_count** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `1024`

    Set the maximum number of trace steps. If the number of collected trace steps exceeds this value, all steps collected later are ignored.

    :::caution

    If you increase the setting too high, the memory usage increases. We recommend that you do not change the default values. 

    :::

-   **profile_step_heavy_count** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `1000`

    If the collection number of basic steps is exceeded, only the steps whose execution time exceeds profile_step_heavy_time are collected. Set the count of the step that can be collected. In case of default settings, if `profile_step_normal_count` is 800, up to 200 steps are collected.

-   **profile_step_heavy_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

    Default `100`

    Set the criterion of heavy steps. If the execution time is greater than the set value and `profile_step_normal_count` is exceeded, recording is made within `profile_step_heavy_count`.

-   **profile_basetime** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

    Default `500`

    Transaction trace data is not collected if a transaction is terminated within the set value. The first URL called in every 5 minutes and the erroneous profile data are collected.

-   **query_string_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    It enables the function to collect query strings of the transaction URL together. It is applied to only the URLs registered in `whatap.query_string_urls`.

-   **query_string_urls** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Register URLs to collect query strings from every transaction.

## HTTP transaction tracing

-   **trace_normalize_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `true`

    It enables the function to convert and normalize transaction URLs.

-   **trace_normalize_urls** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Set the target URL to transform and normalize. It deletes the path parameter by transforming the call URL patterns.      

    :::note

    For example, if it is set as **/a/{v}/b**, the called transaction URLs are transformed to the **/a/{v}/b** format. To register multiple items, comma (,) is used as the delimiter.

    :::

-   **trace_ignore_url_set** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `0`

    If a specific URL is set, the corresponding transactions are excluded from tracing. The set URLs are not displayed in the transaction list because they do not collect transaction data. Set URLs to exclude from transaction tracing. To set multiple items, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

-   **trace_ignore_url_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `0`

    It sets URL prefixes to exclude from the transaction tracing.

-   **profile_http_header_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    It is used to record the HTTP headers in the trace history.

-   **profile_http_header_ignore_keys** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `host,accept,user-agent,referer, accept-language, connection`

    It is used to record HTTP headers in the profile details. The set HTTP header names are excluded from collection, and they are marked with "#."

-   **profile_http_parameter_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    It is used to record HTTP parameters in the trace history. The parameters can be viewed by entering a separate security key. The name and value of the text type are collected among Get and Post parameters. Up to 40 items (20 Gets, 20 Posts) are collected, and parameter names and values are collected up to 256 bytes.

    :::note

    The security key is set to 6 characters within the `WHATAP_HOME`_/paramkey.txt_ file where the _whatap.conf_ file is located. If the _paramkey.txt_ file does not exist, it is automatically created with a random value.

    :::

-   **profile_http_parameter_url_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `/`

    It is used to define the prefix of URL to record HTTP parameters in the trace details.

-   **profile_http_host_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    The transation host is output. If the value is `false`, only the URI is recorded in the URL of a transaction. If the value is `true`, the output has the format of `/xxx.aaa.com/URL`.

-   **biz_exceptions** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `Empty`

    Set a specific error or exception as business exception. It is not recorded as an error in the hitmap but collected in the statistics. It is applied the same as the error class name that is collected. Multiple items can be registered using comma (,) as the delimiter.

-   **ignore_exceptions** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Register any exceptions to ignore. The errors of the registered exceptions are ignored. The strings to be excluded are the strings for class items related to error types or error statistics in the profile.

    The type of error that occurs in Go is displayed as a string.

    ```go
    thr.ErrorClassName = fmt.Sprintf("%T", err)
    thr.ErrorMessage = err.Error()

    # Output the error type

    *errors.errorString
    *echo.HTTPError
    *url.Error
    ```

## Transaction tracing

-   **trace_active_transaction_slow_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

    Default `3000`

    In the active transaction arc equalizer graph on the dashboard that checks collected data, specify the criteria for the transaction response time that can be recorded as a slow section. If the transaction response time exceeds the set time, the number of slow active transactions is included.

-   **trace_active_transaction_very_slow_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

    Default `8000`

-   **trace_active_transaction_lost_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

    Default `30000`

    If a transaction does not end within the timeout period (5 minutes), no further transaction data is collected. You can see `Lost Connection` in the transaction trace information.

-   **trace_useragent_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    If the value is `true`, the user agent data for transactions is collected. 

-   **trace_referer_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    If the value is `true`, the referer data for transactions is collected.

## Multiple transaction trace

-   **mtrace_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    It sets whether or not to use the multi-transaction tracing (MTID). By tracing the MTID, you can check the calls between all the registered applications.

-   **mtrace_rate** <span class='type'>Percentage</span>

    Default `10`

    This option sets the issuance rate of the MTID (Multi Transaction ID) issued when the first transaction occurs.

-   **mtrace_poid_key** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `x-wtap-po`

    Set the key name to deliver the caller project information to for MTID tracing.

-   **mtrace_caller_key** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `x-wtap-mst`

    Set the caller key name to be used for MTID tracing.

-   **mtrace_callee_key** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Default `x-wtap-tx`

    Set the callee key name to be used for MTID tracing.

-   **mtrace_send_url_length** <span class='type'>Int</span>

    Default `80`

    The HTTP caller passes its URL to callees. At this time, the URL length is restricted. This sets the length value.
