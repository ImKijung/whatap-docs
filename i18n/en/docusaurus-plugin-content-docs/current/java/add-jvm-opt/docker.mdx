description: The step-by-step instructions on how to apply the WhaTap Java monitoring agent to Java applications in the Docker environment are provided. Users can add more Whatap Java agent settings to the existing Docker image to see the processes for building a new image, creating the whatap.conf file, writing a Dockerfile, and modifying JAVA_OPT. Additional JVM options for Java 17 or later and the method how to configure the heap histogram lookup for various Java versions are also provided.

## Applying the agent

Based on an existing Docker image, build an image with the WhaTap agent settings added.

:::note

This document covers only the installation of the Java agent. To apply with WhaTap Kubernetes monitoring, see [the following](../../kubernetes/install-docker-java).

:::

1. Create a Docker build directory.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p {Docker build dir}
   ```

2. Create the _whatap.conf_ file.

   ```docker {3,5} showLineNumbers
   cat >{Docker build Dir}/whatap.conf <<EOL
   #Enter the access key.
   license=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX 
   #Enter the collection server IP.
   whatap.server.host=xx.xx.xx.xx/yy.yy.yy.yy 
   EOL
   ```

3. Create a Dockerfile.

   In case of building an image, you can copy the jar file to apply in the `-javaagent` option from the WhaTap image.

   ```docker
   cat >/home/silver/whatap/docker/Dockerfile <<EOL
   FROM whatap/kube_mon as build
   ## Create an actual image (Add the WhaTap image)
   ## $Image_Name (image name)
   FROM $Image_Name
   RUN mkdir -p /whatap
   COPY --from=build /data/agent/micro/whatap.agent-*.jar /whatap
   COPY ./whatap.conf /whatap/
   #...
   EOL
   ```

4. In `JAVA_OPT`, add the following content.

   ```bash
   WHATAP_HOME=/whatap
   WHATAP_JAR=ls ${WHATAP_HOME}/whatap.agent-*.jar | sort -V | tail -1
   export JAVA_OPTS="-javaagent:${WHATAP_JAR} "
   ```

5. Build the Docker.

   ```bash
   cd docker
   docker build -t $Image_Name
   ```

:::note

import Java17 from "./_java-17.mdx";

<Java17 />

:::

:::note

You can modify the Java agent file name by using the `Rename` function. Once the Java agent name has been modified, enter a new name in `JAVA_OPTS`.

**Example of how to modify the Java agent name**

```bash
java -cp whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar whatap.agent.setup.Rename -from whatap.agent-X.Y.Z.jar -to whatap.agent.jar
```

import Setheapmemory from "./_set-heap-memory.mdx";

<Setheapmemory />

## Starting the monitoring

import Startapm from "../../common-items/_start-apm.mdx";

<Startapm />
