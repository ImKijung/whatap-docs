### Agent installation file configuration{#agent-files}

The agent file consists of a tracer that extracts data for application monitoring and passes to the WhaTap collection server, and the elements that help the tracer send the data.

- _whatap.conf_

  This configuration file stores monitoring agent settings, access key, and WhaTap data collection server IP. For more information, see [the following](set-agent).

- _ping.sh(bat)_

  This script (batch) file checks whether there are any settings or network issues by attempting communication with the access key and WhaTap data collection server.

- _proxy.sh(bat)_

  Script (batch) file to start the _whatap.agent.proxy-`X.Y.Z`.jar_ file.

- _resmon.sh(bat)_

  Script (batch) file to check whether the CPU, memory, and disk data are collected normally.

- _whatap-logsink-lz4-`X.Y.Z`.jar_

  This plug-in file collects the log data of the application server.

- _whatap.agent-`X.Y.Z`.jar_

  This monitoring agent file collects and transfers various monitoring data of the application server to the collection server.

- _whatap.agent.proxy-`X.Y.Z`.jar_

  This application acts as a transit in the proxy server (pass-through server), when the server where the application server operates cannot connect directly to the WhaTap collection server.

import Conf from "../common-items/_whatap_conf.mdx";

## Adding the JVM options{#addjvmopt}

The method how to set depending on the application server environment is provided as follows. Before installing and applying the agent, check [Support environment](supported-spec) first.
