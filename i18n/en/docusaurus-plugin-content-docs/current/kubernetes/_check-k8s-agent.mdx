- You can check the status of the master agent and node agents by executing the following command:

  ```bash
  kubectl get pod -n whatap-monitoring
  ```

  After installing the master and node agents, start monitoring the resources in your Kubernetes environment. Go to [Whatap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io) and then check the performance data collection in **_Project list_** and **_Dashboard_** > **_Container Map_**.
