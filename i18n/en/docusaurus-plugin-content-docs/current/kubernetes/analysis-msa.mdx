The MSA analysis function analyzes the proportion of calls between transactions collected through the WhaTap's **Multiple transaction trace** function. Based on this, dependencies between microservices can be checked at the URL level rather than instance-centric basis.

![Microservice Architecture Pattern](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_application_analysis_msa_pattern.png)

For example, there are five microservices: A, B, C, D, and E. If a user calls A, it is assumed that the following three call patterns occur according to the logic. 

1.  A→B, C calls
2.  A→B, C calls + then B→D call
3.  A→B, C calls + then B→D, E calls 

If these three patterns have been performed once, MSA analysis can check the association analysis data depending on the reference URL.

## MSA Transaction Statistics

The following lists all the transaction statistics that have callers or callees.

If you select the ![Detail icon](/img/ic-pageview.svg) **_Detail_** icon of the URL to see among the statistical data above, the detailed view window appears. In the detailed view window, you can see the detailed data such as **_Caller callee summary_**, **_Caller callee data_**, and **_Caller callee trend_** for the transaction. 

:::note 

If you select ![Total view icon](/img/ico-detail-mode.svg), the detailed view window appears in full screen.

## Caller Callee Summary

The **_Caller callee summary_** tab displays the dependency data between the caller and callee of the URL. At this time, numerical data whose maximum is 1 such as 0.004 and 0.003, appears together, which indicates the proportion of all callers. Likewise, the gravities for each callee appear on the right.

<ImgLang img='whatap_application_analysis_msa_3.png' desc='Caller Callee Summary' />

Through the above screen, you can analyze the dependencies between callers and callees based on the _/account/save/employee/seoul_ transaction.

The caller or callee nodes can be expanded into sub-nodes as follows:

## Caller & Callee Data

The correlations between callers and callees for the reference URL (e.g. _/account/save/employee/seoul_) can be displayed in a table as follows.

## Caller Callee Trend

The reference URL (_/account/save/employee/seoul_) and the trend of calls between a caller or a callee can be analyzed in time series as follows.
