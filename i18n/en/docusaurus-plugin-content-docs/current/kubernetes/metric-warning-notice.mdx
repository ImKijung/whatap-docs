For more information about the `reason` field in the Kubernetes event, see [Kubernetes official documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/events/event.go#L27). 

:::

#### **_BackOff_**

The alert occurs when `BackOff` is entered several times in the `reason` field in a Kubernetes event. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows: 

> Kubernetes Event (Kube Event `${message}`)

#### **_Evicted_**

The alert occurs when `Evicted` is entered several times in the `reason` field in a Kubernetes event. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> Kubernetes Event (Kube Event `${message}`)

#### **_FailedCreatePodSandBox_**

The alert occurs when `FailedCreatePodSandBox` is entered several times in the `reason` field in a Kubernetes event. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> Kubernetes Event (Kube Event `${message}`)

#### **_FailedMount_**

The alert occurs when `FailedMount` is entered several times in the `reason` field in a Kubernetes event. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> Kubernetes Event (Kube Event `${message}`)

#### **_FailedScheduling_**

The alert occurs when `FailedScheduling` is entered several times in the `reason` field in a Kubernetes event. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> Kubernetes Event (Kube Event `${message}`)

#### **_FailedSync_**

The alert occurs when `FailedSync` is entered several times in the `reason` field in a Kubernetes event. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> Kubernetes Event (Kube Event `${message}`)

#### **_NodeNotReady_**

The alert occurs when `NodeNotReady` is entered several times in the `reason` field in a Kubernetes event. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> Kubernetes Event (Kube Event `${message}`)

#### **_Unhealthy_**

The alert occurs when `Unhealthy` is entered several times in the `reason` field in a Kubernetes event. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> Kubernetes Event (Kube Event `${message}`)

#### **_Notification of utilization based on container CPU quota_**

The alert occurs when the total CPU usage (`${cpu_per_quota}`) based on the container's CPU limit is 70% or more. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> The CPU utilization of container `${oname}` in `${okindName}` is high, `${cpu_per_quota}`% >= 70%.

#### **_Container memory fail count_**

If the container's memory limit is reached more than once, the alert occurs. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> Because the `${oname}` container of `${okindName}` exceeded the limit, the `${mem_failcnt}` increased.

#### **_Container memory utilization_**

The alert occurs when the usage (`${container.mem_percent}`) based on the container's memory limit is 90% or more. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> The memory usage of `${oname}` container in `${okindName}` is `${container.mem_percent}`% >= 90%.

#### **_Container DEAD status notification_**

The corresponding alert occurs when the container status code is `100`. The status code `100` indicates `DEAD`. The example of <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> is as follows:

> Container `${oname}` is in `DEAD` state.

#### **_Cluster CPU request notification_**

The corresponding alert occurs when the available amount of CPU for node allocation divided by the total limit CPU and multiplied by 100 is 80% or more. The example of <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> is as follows:

> The CPU request (minimum required resource) is more than 80% of the cluster CPU allocation.

#### **_Cluster memory request notification_**

The corresponding alert occurs when the available amount of memory for node allocation divided by the total limit memory and multiplied by 100 is 80% or more. The example of <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> is as follows:

> Memory Request (minimum required resource) is more than 80% of the cluster memory allocation.

#### **_Cluster CPU request notification_**

The corresponding alert occurs when the available amount of CPU for node allocation divided by the total limit CPU and multiplied by 100 is 60% or more. The example of <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> is as follows:

> The CPU request (minimum required resource) is more than 60% of the cluster CPU allocation.

#### **_Cluster memory request notification_**

The corresponding alert occurs when the available amount of memory for node allocation divided by the total limit memory and multiplied by 100 is 60% or more. The example of <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> is as follows:

> Memory Request (minimum required resource) is more than 60% of the cluster memory allocation.

#### **_Notification of the number of master pods_**

The alert occurs when there are no Pods that can be allocated to the node. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> The number of PODs that can be allocated to the master is 0.

#### **_Node CPU utilization notification_**

The alert occurs when the node's CPU utilization (`${cpu}`) is 70% or more. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> The CPU usage of `${oname}` is `${cpu}`% >= 70%.

#### **_Node memory utilization notification_**

The alert occurs when the node's memory utilization (`${memory_pused}`) is 90% or more. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> The memory usage of `${oname}` is `${memory_pused}`% >= 90%.

#### **_Unassignable node notification_**

The corresponding alert occurs when the available number of Pods that can be assigned to a node is zero. 

#### **_APDEX_**

The alert occurs when the transaction exists and the APDEX score is less than 0.7. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

The alert occurs when the number of Pods that can be allocated to the node is 0. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> APDEX is lower than 0.7 (`${oname}`)

#### ***HPA CPU 사용률 알림***

현재 실행 중인 Pod의 수가 리소스 내 최대 Pod 수와 같고 CPU 사용률이 70% 이상일 경우 해당 알림이 발생합니다. <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> 예시는 다음과 같습니다.

> HPA POD 생성 최대치에 도달하였고 CPU 사용률이 >= 70% 상태 입니다.

#### ***HPA 메모리 사용률 알림***

현재 실행 중인 Pod의 수가 리소스의 허용 가능한 최대 Pod 수와 같고 메모리 사용률이 90% 이상일 경우 해당 알림이 발생합니다. 

> HPA POD 생성 최대치에 도달하였고 메모리 사용률이 >= 90% 상태 입니다.
