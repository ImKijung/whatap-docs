<ImgLang img='whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile.png' desc='Transaction Search' />

You can search for the desired transaction based on the individual transaction's performance properties.

<ImgLang img='whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_column.png' desc='Select Column' />

To query the result, click ![Column selection icon](/img/ico-column-set.svg) **_Select Column_** to check.

:::note

It is recommended to set the search time as short as possible because a response delay may occur depending on the search conditions.

:::

## Elapsed Time

<ImgLang img='whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_time.png' desc='Elapsed Time' />

Search is performed based on the transaction response time. Search by entering two values above and below the reference.

## Error Message

<ImgLang img='whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_error.png' desc='Error Message' />

Search is performed based on the transaction error message. In the default state, error-related columns may not be seen. Select a column to check.

## HTTP Call Count

<ImgLang img='whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_http.png' desc='HTTP Call Count' />

Search based on the number of outbound HTTP service calls made for transactions.

## SQL Count

<ImgLang img='whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_sql.png' desc='SQL Count' />

Search for transactions where the number of SQL executions per transaction exceeds the set number. Exceptionally, this is used to search transactions that call SQLs excessively.

## SQL Fetch Count

<ImgLang img='whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_sqlfetch.png' desc='SQL Fetch Count' />

After executing an SQL, search based on the number of DB patches. The count is based on the transaction. Use this to search transactions that perform excessive data fetches.

## URL

<ImgLang img='whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_url.png' desc='URL' />

Transactions are searched based on the URL. The entered search string is compared and searched by inclusion (partial matching).

## IP

<ImgLang img='whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_ip.png' desc='IP' />

Transactions are searched based on the IP. However, IP strings are searched by prefix comparison (forward matching).

## Domain

<ImgLang img='whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_domain.png' desc='Domain' />

Transactions are retrieved based on the HTTP service domain (host:port). The search conditions must match the domain completely (full match).

## UserAgent

<ImgLang img='whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_useragent.png' desc='User Agent' />

Search transactions based on the user agent (partial match). 

## Referer

<ImgLang img='whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_referer.png' desc='Referer' />

Search transactions based on the referer string.

:::note

Agents in their default settings do not collect referer data. If the referer configuration is required, see the following to add the related settings.

- [Java](../java/analysis-apm-trs#stat-referer)

- [Node.js](../nodejs/analysis-apm-trs#stat-referer)

- [Python](../python/analysis-apm-trs#stat-referer)

:::

## Transaction ID

<ImgLang img='whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_tid.png' desc='Transaction ID' />

Search transactions based on their transaction ID (full match). For transaction IDs, the search indexes are created for searching at a high speed.

:::note

If you are not using the latest version of the agent, a full scan may occur rather than using indexes.

:::

## Multi Transaction ID

<ImgLang img='whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_mtid.png' desc='Multi Transaction ID' />

Search transactions based on the multi-transaction ID (full match).

:::note

- If you are not using the latest version of the agent, a full scan may occur rather than using indexes.

- When searching with the <Cmdname sid="TTL06107" className="uitext" /> filter applied, only the <Cmdname sid="TTL06111" className="uitext" /> filter can be additionally applied.

:::

## Client ID

<ImgLang img='whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_clientid.png' desc='Client ID' />

The client ID (`wClientId`) is an ID given by the WhaTap agent to identify users. Transactions are searched based on this ID (full match). There is no separate index for searching.

:::note

WhaTap basically stores the client-related information.

:::

## Login ID

<ImgLang img='whatap_application_analysis_tx_profile_loginid.png' desc='Login ID' />

Search transactions based on the login ID.

:::note

Agents in their default settings do not collect login IDs. For more information about the login ID setting, see [the following](../java/script-plugin#common-plugin) to add settings.
