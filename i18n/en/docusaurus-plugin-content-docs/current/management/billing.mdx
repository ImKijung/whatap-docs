WhaTap products are using the deferred payment billing. You can receive an invoice for the previous month's usage within 5 business days of each month via email through the account with the **billing** role. The usage of the previous month is the amount used from the 1st day to the last day of the month. Invoices are created for each account based on the list of paid products registered to the account.

If the subscription period for paid products is in the middle of the month, the period of use is calculated and billed on a pro-rata basis.
