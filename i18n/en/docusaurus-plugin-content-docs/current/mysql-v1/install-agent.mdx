## Downloading the WhaTap database agent

{@include: ../common-items/_db-install-agent-steps.mdx}

3.  Enter the unzipped folder and then check the _whatap.conf_ file. In _whatap.conf_, enter the project access key, WhaTap server data, and DB connection data.

    ```ini title='whatap.conf'
    license=Project access key
    whatap.server.host=13.124.11.223/13.209.172.35 # WhaTap server Info

    dbms=mysql
    db_ip={DB server IP}
    db_port={DB server port number}
    ```

    :::info

    **In case the MySQL server and agents are installed in localhost (default 3306 port)**

    ```ini title='whatap.conf'
    dbms=mysql
    db_ip=127.0.0.1
    db_port=3306
    ```

    :::

4.  Download the JDBC driver to the following directory. _/unzipped folder/jdbc_

    Download the JDBC driver for the OS and version of your database server.

    **Mysql & MariaDB 5.5 or later**

    -   [Connector/J 8.0.11](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)
    -   [Connector/J 5.1.46](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.1.html)

:::tip

-   When using the JDBC driver version 8.x or later, if the `serverTimezone` setting is required in the URL to connect, set the options as follows.

    ```ini title='whatap.conf'
    connect_option=?serverTimezone={SERVER_TIMEZONE}
    # ex) connect_option=?serverTimezone=UTC
    ```

-   To use SSL, set the options as follows.

    ```ini title='whatap.conf'
    connect_option=?useSSL=true&verifyServerCertificate=false
    ```
