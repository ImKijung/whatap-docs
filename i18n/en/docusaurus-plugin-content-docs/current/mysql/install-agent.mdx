## Downloading the WhaTap database agent

import Dbinstallagentsteps from "../common-items/_db-install-agent-steps.mdx";

3. Enter the unzipped folder and then check the _whatap.conf_ file. In _whatap.conf_, enter the project access key, WhaTap server data, and DB connection data.

   ```ini title='whatap.conf'
   license={Access_Key}
   whatap.server.host=13.124.11.223/13.209.172.35 # WhaTap server information

   dbms=mysql
   db_ip={DB_server_IP_address}
   db_port={DB_server_port}
   ```

   :::info

   **In case the MySQL server and agents are installed in localhost** (**default 3306 port**)

   ```ini title='whatap.conf'
   dbms=mysql
   db_ip=127.0.0.1
   db_port=3306
   ```

   :::

4. Download the JDBC driver to the following directory. _/unzipped folder/jdbc_

   Download the JDBC driver for the OS and version of your database server.

   **Mysql & MariaDB 5.5 or later**

   - [Connector/J 8.0.11](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)
   - [Connector/J 5.1.46](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.1.html)

:::tip

- When using the JDBC driver version 8.x or later, if the `serverTimezone` setting is required in the URL to connect, set the options as follows.

  ```ini title='whatap.conf'
  connect_option=?serverTimezone={SERVER_TIMEZONE}
  # ex) connect_option=?serverTimezone=UTC
  ```

- To use SSL, set the options as follows.

  ```ini title='whatap.conf'
  connect_option=?useSSL=true&verifyServerCertificate=false
  ```
