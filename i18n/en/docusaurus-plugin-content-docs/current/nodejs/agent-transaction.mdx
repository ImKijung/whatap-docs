The agent traces the transaction performance and provides the following configurable options.

### Transaction Tracing

{@include: ../common-items/_transaction-profiling-common.mdx}

- **profile_error_step_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  You can add a step to display error information in the profile.

{@include: ../common-items/_transaction-profile-active-color.mdx}

- **hook_method_patterns** <span class='type'>String</span>

  It sets the method to measure the response time. Class full names and methods are separated by the period (.) as the delimiter, and asterisk (\*) can be used as the wildcard. In case of multiple items, comma (,) is used as the delimiter.

  ```ini title='Example'
  hook_method_patterns=a.b.C1.*
  ```

- **hook_method_access_public_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  When setting a method trace, it sets whether or not to treat only the public methods as separate targets.

- **hook_method_access_protected_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  When setting a method trace, it sets whether or not to treat only the protected methods as separate targets.

- **hook_method_access_private_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  When setting a method trace, it sets whether or not to treat only the private methods as separate targets.

- **hook_method_access_none_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  When setting a method trace, it sets whether or not to treat only the no access indicated methods as separate targets.

- **hook_method_ignore_prefixes** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `get,set`

  When setting a method trace, it sets the classes to exclude from the trace with a prefix.

- **hook_method_ignore_classes** <span class='type'>String</span>

  When setting a method trace, it sets the classes to exclude from the trace.

- **trace_service_port_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  Add the port number to the transaction name.

- **httpc_status_ignore** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `Empty`

  If the HTTP status code is an error (`HTTPC_ERROR`), it can be ignored. When listing multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

  ```ini title='whatap.conf'
  httpc_status_ignore=404,500
  ```

- **httpc_status_ignore_set** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `Empty`

  `whatap.error.HTTPC_ERROR` is ignored. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

  :::note

  Set it as `httpc_status_ignore_set=/a/b/c:400,/a/ab/c:404`. In Statistics/Error Analysis, enter the value for `HTTPC_URL`.

### HTTP transaction tracing

{@include: ../common-items/_transaction-trace-common.mdx} 

{@include: ../common-items/_transaction-profile-http.mdx} 

- **trace_ignore_url_set** <span class='type'>String</span>

  It sets URLs to exclude from transaction tracing. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

- **trace_ignore_url_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

  It sets URL prefixes to exclude from transaction tracing. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

- **ignore_http_method** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `PATCH,OPTIONS,HEAD,TRACE`

  Transactions requested by the specified HTTP method are not collected. To set multiple items, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

  ```ini title="whatap.conf"
  # e.g. tracing the transactions whose http_method is OPTIONS or HEAD
  ignore_http_method=PATCH,TRACE

  # e.g. ignoring the transactions whose http_method is OPTIONS or HEAD
  ignore_http_method=OPTIONS,HEAD
  ```

- **status_ignore** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `Empty`

  You can set the HTTP status codes to ignore. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

  ```ini title='whatap.conf'
  # example
  status_ignore=408,500
  ```

- **status_ignore_set** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `Empty`

  Among HTTP status return codes, you can set the codes to ignore on a URL basis.

  ```ini title='whatap.conf'
  # example
  status_ignore_set=/api/test/timeout/{time}:408,/api/test/timeout:200,/error:500
  ```

- **transaction_status_error_enable** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  If an HTTP status code that is not a normal response such as HTTP 401 or 403, is returned, set whether or not to handle it as an error.

### Non-HTTP transaction tracing

- **hook_service_patterns** <span class='type'>String</span>

  It sets the starting point pattern for tracing NON-Http transactions. Wildcard characters cannot be used. To set multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

- **trace_background_socket_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  When a socket (TCP) connection is opened, this open is traced only in transaction start status. This tracing is made when the socket is opened by a background thread rather than a transaction.

### Multiple transaction trace

- **mtrace_rate** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `0`

  This option sets the rate of the MTID (Multi Transaction ID) issued when the first transaction occurs. It can be set from `0` to `100`. By tracing the MTID, you can check calls between all registered applications. For the applications belonging to the same project, you can check transaction traces immediately through the Caller & Callee function.

- **mtrace_spec** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default: `v1`

  Set the application version of the current instance. You can arbitrarily enter a string. This data is used for call statistics.

- **mtrace_caller_key** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `x-wtap-mst`

  Set the caller key name to be used for MTID tracing.

- **mtrace_callee_key** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `x-wtap-tx`

  Set the callee key name to be used for MTID tracing.

- **mtrace_callee_id_recv_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  Upon MTID tracing, the received callee ID is represented in the trace.

- **mtrace_alltx_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  MTIDs of all transactions can be traced to link with the logging system like log4j.

- **mtrace_basetime** <span class='type'>Miliseconds</span>

  Default `100`

  If the value of `mtrace_alltx_enabled` is `true`, it may leave too many logs. In this case, it needs to reduce the amount of trace logging.

- **stat_mtrace_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  It collects correlation statistics between callers and callees. When applied to a caller, the caller details are sent. When applied to a callee, the caller-callee call statistics are sent to the collection server in URL units.
