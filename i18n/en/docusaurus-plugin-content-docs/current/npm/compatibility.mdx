To use WhaTap's **NPM**, install **NPM Agent** on the running servers. Because **NPM** uses the eBPF technology provided by the OS kernel, be sure to check the OS version.

-   It supports the Linux kernel version 5.4 or later.

-   Based on the Linux release version, we recommend Ubuntu 20.04 and CentOS Stream 9 or later.

:::note

-   It is also available through kernel update in case of an older version of Ubuntu and CentOS.

-   Other releases may work with the kernel version matched, but the officially tested releases are for Ubuntu and CentOS.

-   Currently, Windows and mac OS are not supported.
