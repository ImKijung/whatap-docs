## Starting the monitoring

-   When the agent works, it starts collecting the monitoring data. To check the collected data on the service screen, select **_NPM Dashboard_** at the lower right of the screen.

-   **NPM** can collect irregular and diverse data through the **tagRule** settings and display the data in a topography or chart. For more details, see [the following](set-tagrule).
