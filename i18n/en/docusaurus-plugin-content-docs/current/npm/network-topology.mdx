In Network Topology, you can see the relationship between nodes at a glance through the topology chart, and quickly see the performances for each network section that relate the line charts for each metric. Real-time and historical data can be viewed, and the performances of abstracted networks can be visualized and monitored based on the process type or application tags.

## Basic screen guide

<ImgLang img="npm-dashboad-network-topology.png" desc="Network topology" />

On the ![number 1](/img/number-01.png) menu bar, set the options to display on the ![number 3](/img/number-03.png) topology chart. Topology shapes the network with nodes and edges. In parallel with the ![number 2](/img/number-02.png) time series charts for each performance metric, the network bottlenecks or failure sections can be identified more easily.

-   You can move the screen to a desired position by clicking and dragging an empty area of the topology chart.

-   You can zoom in or out the topology chart by scrolling the mouse wheel. You can also use the slide tools at the lower right corner.

-   You can move each node by clicking and dragging it to a desired position.

-   Select the ![Zoom Out icon](/img/ic-fit-content.svg) button on the upper right of the screen to sort the canvas positions so that all nodes are visible on the screen. It is useful for quickly seeing all nodes after filtering tags and repositioning nodes.

-   Just above the topology chart, you can see the summary information such as the total node count, number of tag-filtered nodes, and threshold settings. To hide the time series chart and enlarge the topology screen, select the ![Fold icon](/img/ic-menu-fold.svg) button.

## Setting the topology chart options

You can view and analyze data by setting what to display on the topology chart.

### Edge

<ImgLang img="npm-dashboard-topology-edge.png" desc="Edge" />

**_Edge_** means the node-to-node communication and the labels for each edge display the selected performance metrics. You can select a type of the value to display on the edge of the topology chart. The types of performance metrics that can be displayed on the edge are as follows.

-   **_latency_**

-   **_jitter_**

-   **_bps_**(bit per second)

-   **_pps_**(packet per second)

-   **_sessions_**

### Setting the node size

For the **_node_**, the weight type for node size can be set to display in the topology chart.

-   **_Total bytes_**: The throughput to process data is set by a weight. The data throughput is a sum of the transmitted data and received data.

-   **_Packet counts_**: The packet throughput is set by a weight. The packet throughput is a sum of the transmitted packets and received packets.

### Setting the threshold

The **_threshold_** and **_unit_** can be set for the metrics set to edges. The edges that exceed the threshold are highlighted on the topology. By default, thresholds are set as follows, unless there is a separate setting process.

-   latency > 200 (ms)

-   jitter > 30 (ms)

-   bps > 128 (Mib/s)

-   pps > 50 (K/s)

-   sessions > 100

### Filtering the tags

If the network configuration is too vast and complicated, you can configure a sub network view by selecting some nodes. Select ![Filter icon](/img/ico-filter.svg) on the upper right of the screen. When the tag list set through the **tagRule** option appears, select the nodes to display on the screen.

<ImgLang img="npm-dashboard-topology-tag-filtering.png" desc="" />

Only the communication performance data between the selected tag nodes and the target node appears on the topology chart. If you exclude the nodes merged by **untagged** from the topology and time series charts, or there are no nodes for analysis, uncheck them.

The information configured in this way can be saved through the **_preset_** function and then recalled for analysis.

:::note

-   Only the tags collected during the data lookup period are displayed in the list.

-   To automatically select new added nodes, select the **_Automatically select newly added tags_** option.

-   For more information about the **_Preset_** menu, see [the following](#preset).

:::

<details>
<summary>Usage example</summary>

**To display only some nodes out of all nodes, follow the steps below.**

1.  Select ![Filter icon](/img/ico-filter.svg) on the upper right of the screen.

2.  When the tag list appears, uncheck **_Select All_** and **_Automatically select newly added tags_**.

3.  Select the nodes to display on the topology chart. You can easily find the desired node by searching for the tag name or using the sorting function (![Sort icon](/img/ic-sort-up.svg)).

<ImgLang img="npm-dashboard-topology-tag-filtering-01.png" desc="Usage example 1" />

**To exclude specific nodes out of all nodes, follow the steps below.**

1.  Select ![Filter icon](/img/ico-filter.svg) on the upper right of the screen.

2.  When the tag list appears, select **_Select All_** and **_Automatically select newly added tags_**.

3.  Use the search and sorting functions to unselect the nodes.

<ImgLang img="npm-dashboard-topology-tag-filtering-02.png" desc="Usage example 2" />

:::note

If you select the **_Select All_** option and then unselect some nodes, **_Select All_** is automatically deselected.

## Preset{#preset}

Through the **_preset_** function, you can save the sub network topology view by relating the tag filter function. If there are too many nodes and edges in the topology view, it is recommended to divide and filter the network part and save it as a preset for analysis.

<ImgLang img="npm-dashboard-topology-preset.png" desc="Preset" />

The data saved in the preset is as follows.

-   Node display type

-   Edge display type

-   Threshold value

-   Tag filter

-   Positions for each tag on the topology

### Creating a preset

1.  Set the topology chart options as you want.

2.  Select ![Preset icon](/img/ic-history.svg).

3.  Enter the preset name and then select **_+ Add_**.

### Modifying a preset

<ImgLang img="npm-dashboard-topology-preset-update.png" desc="Preset update" />

If you change some options of the topology chart with a preset selected, the **_Update_** button is exposed in the **_preset_** list. Select **_Update_** to apply the changed options to the selected preset.

:::note

A new preset can be created by selecting **_+ Add_**.

:::

### Deleting presets

To delete unused presets, select ![Delete icon](/img/ico-trash.svg) in the **_Preset_** list.

## Setting the edge label

Among the data displayed on the edge, only the required data can be visually exposed. Select ![Configuration icon](/img/ico-setting.svg) on the upper right of the screen.

<ImgLang img="npm-dashboard-topology-edge-setting.png" desc="Edge setting" />

-   **_Animation_**: Set whether or not to display the animation when the threshold is exceeded.

-   **_Display number_**: Set whether or not to display the edge labels.
