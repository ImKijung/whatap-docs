## What is Transaction Tracing?

{@include: ../common-items/_transaction-profile-step.mdx}

## Detailed analysis

Select **_Analysis_** > **_HITMAP_** and then drag the real-time hitmap. The **_TX Trace_** list appears at the bottom. You can check the transaction data in the selected area from the **_TX Trace_** list. If you select an item from the list, the **_Statistics_** information window appears for the transaction. To analyze the transaction performance, WhaTap collects and displays the properties such as name and client data, transaction performance, and detailed execution records for each section. Let's look at the detailed analysis elements through the **_Statistics_** window. 

:::note

For more information about the hitmap, see [the following](trs-view#detail-analysis).
