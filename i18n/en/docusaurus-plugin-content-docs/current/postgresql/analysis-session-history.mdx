In <Cmdname sid="side_sessionHistory" className="uitext" />, you can see what has been performed in a specific session during the query period. It provides information that allows you to check how much resource has been used for SQL for a long-running session and analyze the causes.

## Basic usage guide

You must enter the session number (<Cmdname sid="TTL06802" className="uitext" />) to monitor as a required value, but it is more efficient to enter through the <Cmdname sid="side_dbMonitoring" className="uitext" /> menu.

1. Go to <Cmdname sid="side_dashboard" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_dbMonitoring" className="uitext" />.

2. Select a session that is running and not ended for a long time.

3. If the <Cmdname sid="session_detail" className="uitext" /> window appears, select <Cmdname sid="TTL06721" className="uitext" />.

The <Cmdname sid="side_sessionHistory" className="uitext" /> menu appears that has searched the process ID (PID) of the selected session.

Active session data collected every 5 seconds from the selected session is used to construct a chart and its list and provide information that can be used for analysis. 

- **_Wait_**: You can see the percentage of waiting events through a chart.

- **_Cpu_**: You can see the change trend in CPU usage through the chart.

- **_Memory_**: You can see the change trend in memory usage through the chart.

- **_Disk I/O_**: You can see the change trend in disk usage through the chart.

If you select the **_query_** column on the utmost right of the list, the <Cmdname sid="TTL06224" className="uitext" /> window appears where you can see the SQL statement. It contains full texts and plan information for the selected query.
