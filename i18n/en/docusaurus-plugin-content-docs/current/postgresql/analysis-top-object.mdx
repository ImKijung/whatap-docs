It provides objects with the bloating size, scan count, DML execution count, and objects with many dead tuples for each object (table, index) of individual instance, and provides information to identify objects that are used a lot and perform Vacuum or Analyze at appropriate times.

<ImgLang img='db-top-object.png' desc='Top object' />

Set <Cmdname sid="date" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="instance" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="TTL06346" className="uitext" />, and <Cmdname sid="TTL06345" className="uitext" /> to view on the screen and then select ![Search icon](/img/ico-btn-search.png). The results for the selected conditions appear in the table.

:::note

-   The <Cmdname sid="dbObjectInfo" /> data is collected once a day. For more information about the related agent settings, see <Link to="#set-agent-topObject">the following</Link>.

-   This function is supported in DBX agent 1.6.13 or later.

## Bloating

**Bloating** is a phenomenon in which the object size increases due to an increase of unused tuples. 

:::tip

**Tuning tips**

For tables with higher `Bloat_ratio`, consider performing the Vacuum operation. For more information, see the following document.

:::tip

**Tuning tips** 

Consider creating indexes for tables with higher `Seq_scan` and deleting indexes with lower `idx_scan`. For more information, see [the following](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/performance-tips.html).

## DML

Tables with higher `dml_count` values are frequently used tables.

:::tip

**Tuning tips**

Identify major tables and review major issues such as architecture and backup plans.

:::

If <span class="uitext">DML</span> is viewed, the following columns are displayed.

| Column name     | Description                                                          |

## Analyze Time

This list includes objects for which Analyze and Vacuum operations have become outdated.

:::tip

**Tuning tips**

Older tables may have inaccurate statistical information. Review the operations. For more information, see [the following](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/postgresql-vacuum-and-analyze-best-practice-tips).

If <span class="uitext">Analyze Time</span> is viewed, the following columns are displayed.

| `n_mod_since_analyze` | Number of lines changed since last analysis (analyze)             |

## Age

In PostgreSQL, XID (transaction id) is used recursively so that the XID may wrap around at a certain point. To prevent this, `xid_age` (Current XID - XID at the time of creation) must be managed so that it does not keep increasing. If `autovacuum_freeze_max_age` exceeds, Anti-Wraparound Vacuum is automatically performed and `xid_age` is managed below `autovacuum_freeze_max_age`.

:::tip

**Tuning tips**

To lower `xid_age`, review performing the Vacuum operation. For more information, see [the following](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/routine-vacuuming.html#VACUUM-FOR-WRAPAROUND).

:::

If <span class="uitext">Age</span> is viewed, the following columns are displayed.

## Dead Tuple

Dead tuple is the data that has already been deleted using Delete or Update. Review the Vacuum operation to change to free space.

:::tip

**Tuning tips**

To reduce dead tuples, review the Vacuum operation. For more information, see [the following](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/routine-vacuuming.html).
