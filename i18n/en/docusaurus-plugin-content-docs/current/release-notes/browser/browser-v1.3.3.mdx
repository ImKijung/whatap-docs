-   <Status>Feature</Status> Added the AJAX MTID header option (APM integration).

-   <Status>Feature</Status> Added the <code>ignoreErrors</code> error filtering option.

-   <Status>Feature</Status> Added the user ID configuration interface.

-   <Status>Feature</Status> Added the configuration interface for the required collection user IDs.

-   <Status>Feature</Status> The pages loaded as <code>Iframe</code> are excluded from collection.

-   <Status>Fixed</Status> Among the AJAX response values, the status code of the <code>opaque</code> type has been changed from 0 to 10.

-   <Status>Fixed</Status> Excluded the attribute options in the <code>MutaionObserver</code> interface (fixed the issue where overhead occurs when detecting changes in the element's attributes infinitely).
