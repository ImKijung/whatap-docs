-   <Status>New</Status> Adding the web service setting options

    -   **webservice_method_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

        Default `false`

        If the value has been set to `true`, web services can be traced. To apply the set values, restart IIS.

    -   **webservice_method_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

        Enter the name of the method to be traced along with the namespace. Because web services cannot be directly traced, directly enter the method that has used the web services as a trace target. To apply the set values, restart IIS.

        See the following example:

        ```ini title='whatap.conf'
        webservice_method_prefix=Test.Demo, WebServiceDemo.WebService.
        ```

        :::caution

        -   The methods that meet the conditions are traced even if they do not use web services. However, if any methods do not use web services, when an error occurs, the error may not be detected and the transaction can remain unfinished.

        -   If you enter just the class to which the method belongs, all methods within that class are to be traced.
