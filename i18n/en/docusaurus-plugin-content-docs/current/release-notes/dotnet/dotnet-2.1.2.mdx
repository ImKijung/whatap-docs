- <Status>New</Status> WCF is supported.

  - WCF traces through custom methods just like the web services. Therefore, the value of the set option is shared.

    - When the value of the `webservice_method_enabled` option becomes `true`, WCF is also traced.

    - Enter the name of the method to be traced along with the namespace in `webservice_method_prefix`.

- <Status>Change</Status> The Active Stack execution environment is automatically detected.

  - Active Stack operates only when the .NET framework version of the OS is 4.6.1 or later.

  - Even if the value of the `active_stack_enabled` option is set to `true`, Active Stack collection is stopped when the .NET framework version of the OS is earlier than 4.6.1.

  :::note

  The web application supports Active Stack in the version 4.5 or later. For checking the .NET framework version of the OS, see Number 4 of [the following](https://docs.whatap.io/dotnet/supported-spec#use-tools).
