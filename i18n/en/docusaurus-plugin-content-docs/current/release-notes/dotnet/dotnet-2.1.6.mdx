-   <Status>Feature</Status> Added the HTTP request body tracing function.

    -   **profile_http_body_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

        Default `false`

        The body of the HTTP request is recorded in the trace history.

    -   **profile_http_body_url_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

        It is used to define the prefix of the target URL to record the HTTP body information in the trace history.

-   <Status>Feature</Status> Added the user log tracing function.

    This function allows user to leave a log message directly in the trace history. To leave logs, proceed with the following step.

    -   Add a CS file to the project to log in and then write your code.

        ```csharp
        using System;

        namespace Whatap.UserLog
        {
            public static class Tracer
            {
                public static void Trace(string message)
                {
                    // Prevent method calls from being canceled due to compiler optimization
                    // The code inside following method is ignored by the WhaTap agent and will not be executed.
                    Console.WriteLine(message);
                }
            }
        }
        ```

    -   At the location to log, add code in `Tracer.Trace("Log string")` format.

        ```csharp
        public string UserFunction(int value)
        {
            Tracer.Trace($"started... {value}");
            ...
        }
        ```

-   <Status>Fixed</Status> Fixed the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF, web service)-related error.

    Fixed the bug where the tracing target is expanded to all methods including WCF and the targets that cannot be monitored are included, if the `webservice_method_prefix` option is set to `null` and `webservice_method_enabled=true` is set.
