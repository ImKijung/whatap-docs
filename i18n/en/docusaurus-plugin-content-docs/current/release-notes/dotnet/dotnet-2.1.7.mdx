- <Status>Changed</Status> Modified to ignore steps whose count exceeds 1000 to prevent overload caused by too many steps occurring in one transaction.

- <Status>Fixed</Status> Fixed the issue where the HTTP request body is not displayed in the asynchronous calling method.

- <Status>Fixed</Status> Fixed the bug where the HTTP header appears abnormally after a specific time.

- <Status>Fixed</Status> Fixed the error where a public method not related to Windows Communication Foundation (WCF, web service) in the same namespace triggers a transaction, resulting in an abnormal termination of transaction tracing.

- <Status>Fixed</Status> Fixed the error where some files loaded in the IIS memory remain even after deletion of the agent.

- <Status>Deprecate</Status> Deleted the WCF (web service) timeout setting option (<code>webservice_method_timeout</code>).

  - Fixed the timeout error caused by the failure to capture the WCF exit point.

  - However, if the user does not properly handle exceptions in the WCF method, transaction loss may occur. In <Link to='../../dotnet/agent-transaction'>the following</Link>, see the `trace_active_transaction_lost_time` option.
