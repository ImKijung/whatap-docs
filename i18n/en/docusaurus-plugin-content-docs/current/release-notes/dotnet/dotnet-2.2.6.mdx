- <Status>Feature</Status> Added the agent options

  - **trace_ignore_url_set** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Set URLs to exclude from transaction tracing. To set multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

  - **trace_ignore_url_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Set the transaction collection exception URL's prefix. Any URLs whose prefix matches the set value do not collect the transaction performance. To set multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

- <Status>Changed</Status> Modified to select the agent configuration's option to set whether to monitor `System.Data.Common.DbCommand`.

  - Some customers found that errors occurred due to outdated assemblies. Because we could not find a perfect cause to reproduce the error, it was excluded from monitoring.

  - To add it as the monitoring target, set the following agent option and restart IIS.

    :::tip

    **trace_db_command_methods** <span class='type'>String</span>

    Enter the name of the method to monitor. To set multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter. To monitor all methods, apply as follows:

    ```ini title="whatap.conf"
    trace_db_command_methods=ExecuteReader, ExecuteReaderAsync, ExecuteNonQuery, ExecuteNonQueryAsync, ExecuteScalar, ExecuteScalarAsync
    ```
