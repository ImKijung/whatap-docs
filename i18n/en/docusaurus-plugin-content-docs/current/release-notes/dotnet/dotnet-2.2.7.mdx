  - Improved so that it can run even in environments where .NET has not been installed.

  - Fixed the error that occurs when using a lower version of the .NET runtime or when the .NET runtime has not been installed.

- <Status>Fixed</Status> Fixed the bug where the end point is deleted, leaving only the start point during removal of transactions that exceeded the processing allowance.
