-   <Status>New</Status> The <b>ignore_http_method</b> option has been added.

    -   The `http_method` request transaction registered in `ignore_http_method` option is ignored.

    -   The `{PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD, TRACE}` request transactions are ignored by default if no additional values are set.

    ```ini title='whatap.conf'
    # e.g. tracing the transactions whose http_method is OPTIONS or HEAD
    ignore_http_method=PATCH,TRACE

    # e.g. ignoring the transactions whose http_method is OPTIONS or HEAD
    ignore_http_method=OPTIONS,HEAD
    ```

-   <Status>Fixed</Status> Fixed the issue where GET appears when the <code>http_method</code> option is not GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE.

-   <Status>Fixed</Status> Fixed the ASM API version error that occurs upon method tracing.

-   <Status>Fixed</Status> Fixed the problem where the AppServiceStart.x plugin is called repeatedly.
