Select a project in the initial screen of the WhaTap monitoring service, and then select **_Analysis_** > **_CUBE_** under **_Project Menu_**. 

## What is Cube?

We call the performance statistics generated every 5 minutes as **Cube**. Cube analysis uses each 5-minute performance data stored in cubes.

## ![](/img/number-01.png) Cube selection panel

Select a cube based on the specific time in the cube selection panel in the left. Because the cubes are stored every 5 minutes, select a specific time. 

- **Panel interest metric**

  The interest metric in the server cube select panel are **_CPU_** and **_Memory_**.

- **Cube color**

  The cubes are displayed in different colors depending on the number of the selected metrics.

  - <span class='highfg'>Dark blue</span>: <span class='highfg'>high figure</span>

  - <span class='lowfg'>Light blue</span>: <span class='lowfg'>low figure</span>

## ![](/img/number-02.png) Application selector

Through the application selector option in the ![number 2](/img/number-02.png) area at the top, you can select data for specific applications. If you select ![down-arrow](/img/down-arrow.svg) on the right, all available applications can be selected as follows: 

<ImgLang img='cube-select-app.png' desc='Cube selection application'/>

- **_Select All_**: All applications are viewed. By default, **_Select All_** and **_Active Applications_** are selected. 

- **_View Only Selected_**: Among the applications, only the specified applications are queried. 

- **_Search_**: If there are many applications, you can search for them through the input field.

- <font color='5B7DEC'>Number</font>/<font color='979797'>Number</font>: Displays the <font color='5B7DEC'>number of applications specified</font>/<font color='979797 '>number of all applications</font>.
