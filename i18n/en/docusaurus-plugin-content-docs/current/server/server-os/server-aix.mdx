### Running the agent

Execute the following command to start the server monitoring. When the application server runs, it begins collecting monitoring information. 

```bash
echo "license=x4t2322hcqshs-x1q9rv0b9rjvs6-x4jnrqfl5ce5g" |tee /usr/whatap/infra/conf/whatap.conf
echo "whatap.server.host=127.0.0.1" |tee -a /usr/whatap/infra/conf/whatap.conf
echo "createdtime=date +%s%S" |tee -a /usr/whatap/infra/conf/whatap.conf
